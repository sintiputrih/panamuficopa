Over the course of these eight episodes, Roderick Usher (Bruce Greenwood) explains to Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Auguste Dupin (Carl Lumbly) how each of his six children died in the last two weeks. Each of Roderick’s children, named after a Poe character, gets their own episode roughly corresponding to a famous story; that’s clear enough in the series’ episode titles. But within each of those episodes, there’s also a wealth of other references, from direct quotations to minor Easter eggs to nods to the writer’s personal life.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnp2zxom000i3b80jwnr03wr@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text><a data-vars-anchor-text="Episode One: “A Midnight Dreary”" href=#>Episode One: “A Midnight Dreary”</a></span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zxqh000j3b80xyzrxbbj@published data-word-count=203><a href=#><strong>“The Fall of the House of Usher”</strong></a><br>So far, there’s not much here directly pulled from the original story, besides the focus on two twins named Roderick and Madeline Usher and the present-day setting of their rundown childhood home. But Dupin serves the role of the unnamed narrator from the story: He’s here to listen to the stories and musings of his old friend (and current nemesis) Roderick, who may or may not be insane. The flashback to Eliza Usher’s (Annabeth Gish) resurrection during the storm (following a burial to stave off medical intervention) also feels very reminiscent of the climax of the original story, though in that case it was Madeline.<br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><a href=#><strong>“The Cask of Amontillado”</strong></a><br>The opening use of Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall” is a cheeky reference to the method Montresor uses to trap and kill Fortunato — who, as it happens, inspired the name for the Ushers’ corrupt pharmaceutical company in this series.<br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><a href=#><strong>“For Annie”</strong></a><strong> / </strong><a href=#><strong>“Spirits of the Dead”</strong></a><strong> / </strong><a href=#><strong>“The Premature Burial”</strong></a><strong> / </strong><a href=#><strong>“The Imp of the Perverse”</strong></a><br>The episode begins in earnest with a funeral for the final three of Roderick’s six children.

We see during a conversation between his sister Tamerlane (Samantha Sloyan) and her husband Bill-T (Matt Biedel) — more on them later — that Frederick’s siblings resent him for the privilege that comes with his “eldest son” status. That’s true to the spirit of the story, in which Frederick abuses his power after inheriting his father’s vast wealth as an ungrateful teenager.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zxvq000m3b80fk329r9s@published data-word-count=18><a href=#><strong>“Ligeia”</strong></a><br>It makes sense the show’s fictional painkiller Ligodone would derive from this short story about an opium addict.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zxy4000n3b80p1caf0v5@published data-word-count=151><a href=#><strong>“The Raven”</strong></a><br>The episode name comes from the first line of this poem, one of the most famous of all time. The name Verna (Carla Gugino) is an anagram of “raven,” and that fact combined with the adornment at her bar suggests she’s a personification of that iconic bird. We see the raven again after the funeral in 2023 when Roderick collapses and murmurs, “It’s time.” And Lenore, his beloved granddaughter, is named after the narrator’s lost love in the poem.<br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Poe’s Personal Life</strong><br>Roderick and Madeline’s mother is named Eliza after Poe’s mother, who died young of tuberculosis and influenced much of his work. William Longfellow (Robert Longstreet), the former Fortunato CEO and biological father of Roderick and Madeline, is named after the poet whom Poe<a href=#> once accused of plagiarism</a>.

Originally, Prospero was a prince who threw a masquerade ball to entertain the 1,000 other nobles quarantined in an abbey to hide from a deadly plague. In the end, they died anyway, killed by contact with the Red Death — which snuck in wearing a skull mask and red robe. Swapping the prince out for a “Gucci Caligula” playboy type feels right, as does the setting of a condemned Fortunato testing facility. In the show, the irony is underlined: The family’s old unaddressed toxic waste comes back to kill one of their own via acid rain. It feels appropriate for Poe, even in a contemporary context — and the presence of Verna wearing the Red Death’s mask and robe provides another nice reference.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zy36000q3b8022c9xhg3@published data-word-count=25><a href=#><strong>“Annabel Lee”</strong></a><br>In a flashback, a young Roderick (Zach Gilford) recites Poe’s final complete poem, which Roderick wrote for his wife of the same name in-universe.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zy77000s3b80f7mhpw4y@published data-word-count=12><strong>“Metzengerstein”</strong><br>The chemist who developed Ligodone is named Metzer, a shortening of “Metzengerstein.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zy9u000u3b80bs502ovx@published data-word-count=86><strong>Poe’s Personal Life</strong><br>Many think Poe’s actual poem (one of many about beautiful dead women) was inspired by Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe, his wife, who died of tuberculosis just like his mother. (They got married when he was 27 and she was 13, which echoes in Roderick’s weird relationship with the much-younger Juno.) We also see Roderick pitch to Rufus Griswold (Michael Trucco), named after the rival who painted Poe as an addict after his death — an amusing irony, considering Fortunato’s role in the opioid epidemic.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnp2zy0o000o3b809xcsznye@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text><a data-vars-anchor-text="Episode Three: “Murder in the Rue Morgue”" href=#>Episode Three: “Murder in the Rue Morgue”</a></span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zycv000w3b8003ap9hqo@published data-word-count=143><a href=#><strong>“The Murders in the Rue Morgue”</strong></a><br>Okay, now we’re really diverging from the text. The original story is often considered the first detective fiction ever published, introducing Dupin and his marvelous gifts for “ratiocination,” a method that later inspired fictional detectives like Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes. But this isn’t a huge episode for Dupin, who doesn’t do much detective work in this show anyway. Instead, we focus on Camille L’Espanaye (Kate Siegel), one of the two victims from the original story, in which she and her mother are famously killed by a runaway orangutan. Here, she dies when digging for dirt at the facility where her sister Victorine (T’Nia Miller) experiments on chimpanzees: Roderick Usher Experimental, nicknamed (you guessed it) “RUE Morgue.” A tested chimp brutally mauls her, which certainly replicates the horrifying crime scene left by the ape of the original story.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zype000z3b80cpzd5fzy@published data-word-count=15><strong>“The Masque of the Red Death”</strong><br>Camille’s positive PR involves painting Prospero as “America’s fallen prince.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnp2zy4s000r3b80x5u7nknc@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text><a data-vars-anchor-text="Episode Four: “The Black Cat”" href=#>Episode Four: “The Black Cat”</a></span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zyru00103b801rwhtxze@published data-word-count=141><a href=#><strong>“The Black Cat”</strong></a><br>Back to another (relatively) faithful interpretation: Napoleon “Leo” Usher’s (Rahul Kohli) black cat Pluto has the same name as the cat from the story, whose eye the unnamed narrator gouges out while he’s drunk. He later kills the cat, then replaces it with a similar-looking cat — only for the new cat to get trapped in the walls with the wife he killed, leading the police to discover the truth. There’s no wife murder in the show’s take on the material (but many more dead animals), and the events get moved around; the disgusting eyeball-gouging comes later, with the replacement Pluto. As with other stories, this one is tweaked to end in a death rather than an arrest, but it’s basically the same twisted horror story about the dangers of alcoholism, with an axe swapped out for Thor’s hammer.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zyv400113b80vlokj7ze@published data-word-count=19><a href=#><strong>“The Spectacles”</strong></a><br>The name Napoleon comes from one of Poe’s comedy stories, but it seems like the parallels stop there.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zyxf00123b80s39rokbn@published data-word-count=19><a href=#><strong>“The Journal of Julius Rodman”</strong></a><br>Same deal with Leo’s boyfriend Julius, whose name likely comes from Poe’s unfinished serial novel.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnp2zy7d000t3b807zcbtw7a@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text><a data-vars-anchor-text="Episode Five: “The Tell-Tale Heart”" href=#>Episode Five: “The Tell-Tale Heart”</a></span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zz2p00133b802ro28sky@published data-word-count=154><a href=#><strong>“The Tell-Tale Heart”</strong></a><br>It turns out Victorine’s lab was a handy setting for adaptation purposes; not only does it allow for a “logical” in-universe appearance of a murderous ape, but it ties into one of Poe’s other best-known stories. In “The Tell-Tale Heart,” an unnamed narrator’s guilt over killing an innocent old man begins to manifest as an increasingly loud heartbeat. Here, a scientist working on a revolutionary new heart valve kills her girlfriend with a bookend after she threatens to expose Victorine’s falsified records and other crimes. In the wake of the murder, she starts hearing a distinct chirping sound — which reveals itself to be the clamp around poor Alessandra’s heart, still artificially pumping. It’s quite possibly the show’s eeriest, most distinct angle on a Poe story. And stabbing herself to replace the heart for her study is a delightfully deranged piece of nightmare logic that ends the episode on a memorable note.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zz5e00143b80rk3f665q@published data-word-count=17><a href=#><strong>“The Premature Burial”</strong></a><br>Victorine’s actual name comes from this short story about the fear of being buried alive.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnp2zz7u00153b80rnp53z11@published data-word-count=74><strong>“The Raven”</strong><br>The narrator in the poem calls the bird a “thing of evil,” which is echoed in Roderick’s mention of Eliza’s belief that ravens were the minions of Satan because they survived the flood (a story Verna has also, of course, heard).
