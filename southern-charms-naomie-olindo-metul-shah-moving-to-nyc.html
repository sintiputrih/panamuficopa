The change in scenery will come over a year after the Southern Charm star subtly announced she and <a href=#><strong>Chelsea Meissner</strong></a> were <a href=#>leaving the show</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Southern-Charm-Naomie-Olindo-Leaving-Charleston-Moving-To-NYC-With-Metul-Shah-Promo.jpg><p>“I’m so damn proud of you and us @chelseameissner58,” the Bravolebrity commented on her former costar <a href=#><strong>Cameran Eubanks</strong></a>‘ Instagram post in May 2020 after Cameran said she was <a href=#>also quitting Southern Charm</a>.</p><p>Months later, Naomie <a href=#>opened up about her decision to leave the series</a> during a July 2020 episode of the “Skinny Confidential” podcast.</p><p>“I’m so thankful for what the show gave me because it does open a lot of doors and there are a lot of advantages. Then it comes a time when the good doesn’t outweigh the bad anymore where it’s time to walk away,” she said at the time.&nbsp;“Personally, I feel like I walked away at a time that was right for me and that’s how Cam and Chelsea feel too. Other people that aren’t ready to walk away and want to keep doing it, that’s their prerogative and I’m very supportive of that. I still love most of the people on there.”</p><p>However, the Bravo personality admitted that she <a href=#>isn’t in a good place</a> with <a href=#><strong>Kathryn Dennis</strong></a>.</p><p>“I mean, I feel kind of bad saying, but I think I can say I have a strained relationship with Kathryn because I struggle with her filming strategy I guess,” she explained. “I have a relationship with pretty much everybody, except for Kathryn I would say.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kathryn, for her part, doesn’t seem to have plans to leave Charleston any time soon. The South Carolina native, 29, recently <a href=#>moved into a new apartment</a> with her boyfriend, <a href=#><strong>Chleb Ravenell</strong></a>.</p><p>“So we got our first place together! 😏 Let&nbsp;@thehomeedit&nbsp;and peel and stick projects begin,” Kathryn wrote via Instagram last month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp6Wptaa%2BzWaaoZmiosBuusCopKKdXaS5qrrDqGSmnaSquW6%2Fx5qfZqWfq7avs4ytpmamqZh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
