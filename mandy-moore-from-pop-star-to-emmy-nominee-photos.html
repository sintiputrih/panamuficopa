She may have started as a bubblegum pop singer, but <a href=#><strong>Mandy Moore</strong></a> has evolved considerably throughout her two-decade long career.</p><p>The <a href=#>New Hampshire native</a>, 35, burst onto the Hollywood scene in 1999 when she signed with Epic Records as one of their up-and-coming artists. Her first single, “Candy,” reached No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p><p>From that moment on, Moore’s career has had <a href=#>its peaks and valleys</a>, but it was all worth it — especially since it eventually led to an <a href=#>Emmy nomination</a> and massive TV career.</p><p>Once the “Save a Little for Yourself” singer got her feet wet in the music industry — she released five records by the age of 23 — Moore ventured into the film world.</p><p>She first appeared on screen as mean girl Lana Thomas in Disney’s <a href=#>The Princess Diaries</a> in 2001. In the film, she acted, but she also performed “Stupid Cupid” during one scene, showing off her range.</p><p>In 2002, she landed her first leading role as Jamie Sullivan in <a href=#>A Walk to Remember</a>. The movie, which also starred <a href=#><strong>Shane West</strong></a> as Moore’s love interest, did OK at the box office, but nearly 20 years later, the film has become a cult classic with infinite staying power.</p><p>“[It’s] bananas,” Moore <a href=#>told Us Weekly exclusively</a> in January 2018 about the film’s longevity. “It’s crazy. It feels like another lifetime ago. But I’m so happy to celebrate it and so happy that people still — it’s relevant and still means something to people. That means a lot.”</p><p>During her rom-com phase, Moore was also creating new music with her record, Amanda Leigh, coming out in 2009. While the album was her last bit of music to come out for more than a decade, it wasn’t something she totally forgot about.</p><p>Beginning in 2010, the actress focused on her acting career and talent, becoming a Disney Princess with the animated film <a href=#>Tangled</a>. She then appeared in <a href=#>more than 10 movies over the past 10 years</a> before landing the job that changed her career forever in 2016.</p><p>That year, Moore was cast as the matriarch of the Pearson family, Rebecca Pearson, on NBC’s hit drama <a href=#>This Is Us</a>. After being on the show for three seasons, she earned her first Primetime Emmy Awards nomination in 2019.</p><p dir=ltr>In March 2020, the starlet returned to her musical roots by dropping her seventh studio album, <a href=#>Silver Landings</a>. “I missed it,” she told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> of her music comeback in February 2020. “I’m not going to get emotional. I had a lot to unpack about my feelings toward music and my sense of worth in what I brought to the table.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>In addition to her successful Hollywood career, Moore <a href=#>wed Dawes musician <strong>Taylor Goldsmith</strong> in 2018</a> before welcoming their first child, son <a href=#>August</a>, in February 2021.
