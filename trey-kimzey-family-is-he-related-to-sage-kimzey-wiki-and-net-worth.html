Here’s what you need to know. This year, Trey Kimzey has won the championship outright and in split form in four different rodeos. His frequent paychecks have contributed to his season earnings.</strong></p><p>According to traveling companion Creek Young, they haven’t been boosted by victories in a few high-priced rodeos. Sage has won the world title in the Wrangler NFR five years in a row, so he may appear to be the calm amid the bull-riding storm. Trey’s participation this year, on the other hand, has benefited Sage, who is on track to win a record-breaking sixth consecutive title when the 10th round concludes on Saturday night.</p><h2><span id=Is_Trey_Kimzey_Related_To_Sage_Kimzey>Is Trey Kimzey Related To Sage Kimzey?</span></h2><p>Trey Kimzey is a cousin of Sage Kimzey. Sage’s younger brother, Trey Kimzey, is a seven-time world champion bull rider. The pressure had little effect on these two because they had spent their entire lives fighting against their brothers.</p><p>Trey will have the final say this year. He had a once-in-a-lifetime experience when he won the rodeo in Tucson, Arizona, this year. Ted, the patriarch of the Kimzey family, was a former rodeo clown who worked as a barrelman in Tucson rodeos as well as entertaining and working at the WNFR.</p><h2><span id=Kimzey_Brothers_Make_the_NFR_a_Family_Affair>Kimzey Brothers Make the NFR a Family Affair</span></h2><p>Sage Kimzey, the five-time world bull riding champion, was far ahead of the competition in the 2019 global standings, so his spot in Las Vegas was all but certain. Trey Kimzey, his younger brother, fought his way into the top 15 and a trip to the Thomas & Mack Center in his freshman season.</p><p>Parker Breding ended 15th in season earnings with $105,746 and Trey finished 16th with $104,209 in season earnings. He didn’t have to win the match, but he had to finish strong to get a large reward. Trey sealed the deal with an 89.5-point ride on Whamma Jamma, earning $3,952.</p><p>The goal of the entire year, according to Trey, was for them both to be present. Sage was relieved to learn that it was the former. The Kimzey brothers spent the majority of the year traveling together and enjoyed a strong season that included two victories.</p><h2><span id=Trey_and_Sage_Kimzeys_Family_Tree_Explored>Trey and Sage Kimzey’s Family Tree Explored</span></h2><p>Jennifer and Ted Kimzey gave birth to Trey and Sage Kimzey in Strong City, Oklahoma. Ted, a former PRCA barrelman/clown, worked as a barrelman in the 1980 and 1987 National Finals Rodeos. Dusta, their eldest sister, is a pharmacist as well. The Kimzeys lived the rodeo life. Their father encouraged the boys to accompany him as he performed as a rodeo clown and barrelman for crowds along the way. Trey Kimzey competed in nearly every junior high rodeo event, from roping to rough stock riding, but he had one aim in mind at all times.</p><h2><span id=Trey_Kimzey_and_Sage_Kimzeys_Net_Worth_in_2023>Trey Kimzey and Sage Kimzey’s Net Worth in 2023</span></h2><p>Sage Kimzey’s net worth is assessed by allfamousbirthday.com to be $1.5 million. Trey’s net worth, on the other hand, has not yet been disclosed. Sage was awarded the RAM Truck Top Gun Award in Las Vegas because his total NFR earnings of $175,466, which were the highest of any competition, were the most of any participant. As a result, he established a rookie record total (any event or combination) of $318,631.</p><p>Before relocating to Las Vegas, Trey Kimzey enjoyed one of his best regular seasons, earning more than $113,000. Kimzey has prepared well for the ten rides in the Thomas and Mack, with two rides receiving over 90 points and earning large cheques during the season. He finished third and won nearly $12,000 for his 85-point ride earlier in the season at the Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>bull riding champion</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Kofi Kingston- Bio, Height, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>American professional wrestler Kofi Nahaje Sarkodie-Mensah fights for WWE on the SmackDown brand using the ring name Kofi Kingston.
