Shaughnessy hinted that perhaps “things ain’t quite what they seem” in a new interview with SOD.</p><p>As Shaughnessy reflected on his GH character’s exit, he pointed out that Victor’s death itself wasn’t shown on camera.</p><p>ctor’s seemingly dead body was shown in a body bag later, but that leaves some wiggle room for a rewrite that might happen down the road.</p><p>Although Shaughnessy is done filming for now, he suggested that there might be some “further dealings afoot” and seems hopeful about the possibility of Victor coming back at some point.</p><p>It’s possible Victor’s death was faked since he’s definitely the kind of villain who’d do something like that. Victor has all kinds of connections and has proven he can pull off some extreme missions, so it wouldn’t be surprising if he returned in the flesh eventually.</p><p>However, Shaughnessy acknowledged that it might be a situation where Victor is genuinely deceased and comes back in ghost form like Helena Cassadine (Constance Towers).</p><p>After Shaughnessy insisted he’s “not convinced Victor is completely gone,” he pointed out that characters like Helena come back to haunt dreams.</p><p>Shaughnessy clearly views that as a possibility for Victor as well since “there’s always use for a villain” on canvas.</p><p>Once Shaughnessy reiterated that he wasn’t certain Victor was gone forever, he confessed that Victor was at least taking a sabbatical.</p><p>In other words, Victor Cassadine is out of the picture for now, but Charles Shaughnessy believes the door’s been left open for future appearances.</p><p>Whenever the show ends up needing a good villain to shake things up again, maybe they’ll call Shaughnessy up and write a new story for Victor.</p><p>Maybe Victor could return for revenge if he’s still alive after all.</p><p>Regardless, Charles Shaughnessy gave some memorable performances during Victor’s exit arc.</p><p>Shaughnessy is a talented performer and a class act, so many of us will miss watching Victor Cassadine in all his devious glory!</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say Victor’s potential comeback could mean bad news for his old foes, so stay tuned for updates on what might be ahead for creepy Cassadine.</p><p>CDL’s the place to be for exciting <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, updates and news, so make us your top GH source.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2aqqaeZobKzv4ycn5qqnJrAbr%2FHmqygoJ6awLTFjKemrWWTpLu3tc2cnJ1lpp6wtbvRZqCsZZOkurG4xK2cpbFdnLyvsYytnJqrlah6t7XLpZiipqNiv6bA1KulaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
