Many YouTubers and so-called gossip channels have been talking about it for months, even though no one knows for sure.</p><p>It’s hard to think I know a guy with a bubble butt, but it’s not impossible. We all have similar body muscles that we can work on how we see fit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/james-squatting-on-the-gym.jpg><p>So, after doing some research, it’s discovered a fan video and a few photos showing James Charles doing a lot of work on his buttocks. James Charles goes through the motions of trying to achieve a bubble butt, which any girl should do.</p><p>James Charles’ workout consists primarily of conducting a home workout with a few weights, with the majority of them being bodyweight training with props such as a resistance band, ankle weight, and so on, to achieve a more effective result.</p><h4>Diet Plan</h4><p>The James Charles Diet Plan is still a mystery. He has, however, made several posts in which he is seen consuming various cuisines. Charles follows a regimen that includes eating properly while also enjoying other activities and eating outside with friends.</p><p>He enjoys eating salad and maybe some fries or chips while at work.

Last week, the YouTuber traveled to Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, from his home in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>According to government instructions, you can travel for urgent circumstances or if it is necessary for your approved work, but you should not go on holiday.</p><p>Furthermore, the Hawaiian government states that all travelers entering the country must undergo an obligatory two-week quarantine period.</p><p>Disobedience to the quarantine laws may be considered a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine and/or jail time. Quarantine is not required if the tourist has tested negative before entering Hawaii.</p><p>James posted several photos from his trip to Hawaii to social media, including a TikTok video of himself writhing on the beach. However, other TikTok viewers harassed the cosmetic artist in the comments area of his video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/james-charles-on-vacation-1024x576.jpg><p>Now, James might have been on the island for work and could have taken a test before traveling to Hawaii, avoiding the necessary quarantine requirement; nonetheless, many people thought he was selfish by traveling regardless.</p><p>James was chastised in a viral TikTok by a Hawaiian citizen for visiting the country.</p><p>“So, anyone wants to offer me a good reason why James Charles is here in the middle of a pandemic? Is it possible to survive on an island with only 24 critical care ICU beds? “he wrote in the caption.</p><p>James was also accused of deleting comments made by people who had slammed him on social media.</p><p>The post went on to say: “Also, why are you blocking Kanaka creators who are criticizing you, James?
