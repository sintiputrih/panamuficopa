We are often forced to supplement our incomes with dual jobs, extra side gigs, or various freelance opportunities, because this career is simply not made for money-seekers.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=720 data-current-count=1066 data-injectable=true>There are the rare exceptions, of course. Sometimes a journalist breaks a massive story and, through later published works, find a much higher paycheck waiting on the other side, but most of us never get that chance. The likes of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keith Morrison</a></strong> and Anderson Cooper managed to find success, and wealth, through their largely non-lucrative profession, but they’ve got a few points in their favor. Both are part of a winning formula on television, which — in Morrison’s case — combines journalistic skills with police investigations <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and true crime intrigue</a>. Dateline has been on the air for more than 30 years now, and it’s still going strong, thanks to the incredible team that keeps things running.</p><h2 id=h-keith-morrison-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>Keith Morrison’s net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Keith_Morrison.jpg><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true>He’s not technically the host of Dateline, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keith Morrison has been a vital element</a> of the news program’s success since 1995. Over his nearly 30 years working as a correspondent for the program, Morrison has received high praise from viewers, and his reporting style is iconic among frequent NBC viewers — and even earned him several late night parodies on SNL.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=false>For his work with Dateline, as well as Today Show, The Journal, and The Editors, Morrison earned quite the reputation — and a net worth to match. He may not boast Taylor Swift levels of cash, but $8 million is an impressive number for a journalist. That’s what he’s currently worth, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, thanks in large part to his high salary over at Dateline. The program reportedly pays him around $3 million a season, which leaves the 76-year-old with a nice tidy sum awaiting him, should he ever choose to retire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZSWwaa4yKecZqCfqMFut8Siq6FlnaS%2Fs7XSqKWsZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
