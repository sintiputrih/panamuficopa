Before joining Destiny’s Child, she was part of a group called Girl’s Tyme, which included other singers like Kelly Rowland and LaTavia Robinson. Beyonce was only 12-years-old when their group <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">debuted their singing skills on the reality show Star Search</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyonce may owe a lot to reality television, but don’t expect to see her opening up on TV anytime soon. Now that she’s grown, the singer seems to have an aversion to reality television – she even (allegedly) <a href=#>missed Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s wedding because of it</a>.</p><p>Below, we take a look at why Beyonce has never opened up about her personal life on reality television, and how she connects with her fans instead.</p><h2 id=beyonce-thinks-that-reality-tv-is-ldquo-tacky-rdquo>Beyonce Thinks that Reality TV Is “Tacky”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/beyonce-interview.png><p>Kim Kardashian is the queen of reality television. So, when it came to her 2014 wedding to Kanye West, it wasn’t surprising that certain elements were filmed for her family’s long-running show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyonce and Jay Z were extended an invitation to the Italian ceremony, as he was a long-time collaborator and friend of Kanye. However, the couple ended up not attending the wedding.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Beyoncé Was Banned From Performing At Her Mother's Wedding, And The Reasoning Makes Complete Sense</a></span></p><p>The pair reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Kim and Kanye that a family emergency</a> prevented them from coming at the last-minute. But reports suggest there was a different reason Beyonce and Jay-Z bowed out. One report said that Beyonce was concerned about being filmed at the wedding, and she thought it was tasteless Kimye was allowing cameras to be present on their big day.</p><p>"Under no circumstances will [the couple] be a part of any filming on the wedding day if it's for Kim's reality show,” a source told Radar Online prior to Kim and Kanye’s wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The insider added that Beyonce believes Kim’s decision to film the wedding was “tacky,” which may speak to the singer’s overall feelings about sharing one’s life on reality television. "Jay and Beyoncé's wedding was shrouded in secrecy and extreme lengths were made to make sure their wedding was an intimate affair for friends and family, only,” the source continued.</p><p>“[Kimye’s] will be the complete opposite. She thinks it’s just tacky,” they added. “Beyoncé’s motto has always been, less is more. But clearly when it comes to Kim, more means more.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Meeting Beyonce Almost Turned Into A Nightmare For Adele, And We Completely Understand Why</a></span></p><h2 id=beyonce-is-too-controlling-of-her-image-to-do-reality-tv>Beyoncé Is Too Controlling Of Her Image To Do Reality TV</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar51944225.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reality television exposes its subjects and their personal lives, which contrasts with Beyoncé’s clear desire to keep her personal life under wraps. Barely any details or photos from her 2008 wedding to Jay-Z have been shared publicly, and only a few images existed of their twins in the babies’ first few years of life.</p><p>Beyoncé’s life is already highly publicized – her fans want to know everything about her. It’s understandable that she’d want to keep certain elements private, especially when raising her kids, which explains why fans have never seen her sign on to reality television.</p><p>On top of that, Beyoncé is infamous for wanting to control her image. She may feel out of control of her brand if she exposed herself on reality TV.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Beyonce Broke The Royals' Rules When She First Met Meghan Markle</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, it was alleged that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyonce’s publicist attempted to get unflattering photos</a> of the singer from her 2013 Super Bowl half-time performance removed from the Internet. Queen B apparently made the request since she found the images to be unattractive.</p><p>There exist tons of unflattering screenshots, GIFs, video compilations, and more of the Kardashian-Jenner family thanks to their many years on reality television, and it’s the same for many reality stars. Given how controlling Beyoncé is of her image, it’s probably unfathomable for her to open herself up to such (potentially) negative publicity.</p><h2 id=beyonce-does-documentaries-and-movies-instead>Beyoncé Does Documentaries And Movies Instead</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar51944227.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s unlikely that Beyoncé will ever appear on reality television, save for a cameo here or there. But she’s not shy to get behind the camera. Beyoncé has acted in a number of movies over the years, including Dreamgirls, The Pink Panther, Austin Powers in Gold Member, and Obsessed. She has a clear preference for putting her acting skills to work rather than filming her personal life a la Kardashian-style.</p><p>Despite her private nature, Beyonce has opened up for her fans, mainly in the form of documentaries. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2019’s Homecoming was huge</a>, which gave fans an insider look into how the singer prepped for her 2019 Coachella performance.</p><p>She’s also released more personal documentaries, such as HBO’s Life is But a Dream in 2013, which included home-recorded footage of the singer while pregnant with her first child, Blue Ivy, as well as messages written to her husband and live-time reactions to good news.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans can expect Beyoncé to keep a tight hand on her and her family’s image, but she won’t leave her followers completely in the dark. They’ll just have to wait for her next project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbymv4ybnLKnnpiybr7En6ysnV2pvG6wzmapnpmcnsG6edOeo56umai2sLqO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
