Measles is an infectious and highly contagious disease which is caused by the measles virus. On the flip side, rubella is an infectious and often mild disease which is caused by the rubella virus<strong>.</strong> This disease is so much mild that even half of the people do not realize that they are infected by it. Measles usually develops in 10–12 days when exposed to the infected person and lasts for 7–10 days. Whereas Rubella starts in about two weeks when exposed to the infected person and then lasts for three days. Common complications of Measles include pneumonia (6%), diarrhea (in 8% of cases) and middle ear infection (7%) while, complications due to Rubella may include testicular swelling, inflammation of nerves and bleeding problems.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=comparison-chart></span>Comparison Chart<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Measles</strong></td><td><strong>Rubella</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Measles is highly contagious and caused by the measles virus.</td><td>Rubella is a mildly infectious disease caused by the rubella virus.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Also Known As</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Measles is also known as “Rubeola.”</td><td>Rubella is also called “three-day measles” or “German measles.”</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Causes</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Measles virus is the main cause of disease Measles.

It is an unpleasant condition and is highly contagious. The respiratory tract is infected first by the measles virus. Measles only occurs in humans but not in other animals. It is an airborne disease which can easily spread through the sneezes and coughs of infected people. Nine out of ten people who share living space with the infected person will get infected by this disease. There are 24 known genetic types of Measles, while only six are currently circulating.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-rubella></span>What is Rubella?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Rubella (German measles) is a rare illness, and it causes a spotty rash. It generally gets better in about seven days (1 week). Rubella can be serious during pregnancy. Rubella is the disease which generally spread through the air through coughs of the people who are infected by the rubella virus. People suffering from it are infectious to others during the week before and after the start of the rash. Its symptoms are so mild that it is difficult to notice them.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=key-differences></span>Key Differences<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><li>Measles is a highly contagious disease spread by the measles virus, whereas Rubella is a mildly infectious disease caused by the rubella virus.</li><li>Measles is also known as “Rubeola,” whereas Rubella is also known as “German measles” or “three-day measles.”</li><li>Measles include symptoms like a blocked or runny nose, watery eyes, sneezing, swollen eyelids, a high fever which may reach about 40C ( 104F ), red eyes that may be sensitive to light and a general lack of energy, on the other hand, the symptoms of Rubella are often so mild that it is difficult to notice them.

On the other hand, Rubella is a mildly infectious disease caused by Rubella virus and is preventable with a single dose of the rubella vaccine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDx5qrZqGjZMSprdNmoKxlpJ2ybrDIn52eqpWjsKZ5wZ6rsJ2Vo3quscCso56rXZa7pXnRrpmepJyWfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
