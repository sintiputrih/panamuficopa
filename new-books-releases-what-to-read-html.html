French writer and longtime insomniac Marie Darrieussecq would like to know. Insomnia and writing “both thrive on the fantasy of the chosen,” she writes. A product of 20 years of sleep struggles, this strange but delightful book intertwines a diary of the author’s own restlessness with her collected evidence of the nighttime woes of other writers, including Proust, Duras, Kafka, and Césaire, and their pharmacological means to achieve rest. From a series of photos of the author’s hotel beds over the years to a spiraling account of the things that keep us up — ghosts, babies, trauma, a lack of ­shelter — this book examines a roving mind with the nocturnal logic of association and quiet.&nbsp;—Jasmine Vojdani</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=HirgYN data-merchant-id=218185 data-track-name="Sleepless: A Memoir of Insomnia, by Marie Darrieussecq, translated by Penny Hueston (September 5)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=HirgYN data-merchant-id=218186 data-track-name="Sleepless: A Memoir of Insomnia, by Marie Darrieussecq, translated by Penny Hueston (September 5)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=17.95 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> at Bookshop Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=ev7qlB data-merchant-id=218187 data-track-name="Wednesday’s Child, by Yiyun Li&nbsp;(September 5)" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Farrar, Straus and Giroux" data-track-price=23 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ab4/2bc/bfeff4fd47ec595a1795be9f83c29d5bd0-vaster-wilds.rdeep-vertical.w245.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=ev7qlB data-merchant-id=218187 data-track-name="Wednesday’s Child, by Yiyun Li&nbsp;(September 5)" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Farrar, Straus and Giroux" data-track-price=23 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Wednesday’s Child, by Yiyun Li&nbsp;(September 5)</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$23</span> $27<span> now 15% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$23</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllgxtmmh003k3b6x611qh8ec@published data-word-count=160>The Chinese-born writer who actively chose “to be orphaned” from her native language in favor of English, which she considers her “private language,” follows last year’s extraordinary The Book of Goose with a collection whose title is plucked from a nursery rhyme. Written over the course of a decade, these stories take up the author’s familiar themes of mourning, motherhood, and aging. In the titular story, a mother whose teen daughter appears to have killed herself travels alone during the pandemic and remarks that “there are very few things in life that are impervious to time’s erosion.” In “When We Were Happy We Had Other Names,” a bereaved mother compares a child’s death to “the probability of an ant’s being struck by lightning” and then having to “survive and toil on” before she attempts to use a spreadsheet to quantify a lifetime of loss. Few writers tackle the way grief reverberates through our lives with Li’s frankness, tact, and humor.&nbsp;—J.V.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=ev7qlB data-merchant-id=218187 data-track-name="Wednesday’s Child, by Yiyun Li&nbsp;(September 5)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=23 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$23</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=ev7qlB data-merchant-id=218188 data-track-name="Wednesday’s Child, by Yiyun Li&nbsp;(September 5)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=27 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$27</span> at Bookshop Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=w4KZlZ data-merchant-id=218189 data-track-name="The Fraud, by Zadie Smith (September 5)" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Penguin Press" data-track-price=26 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/07b/371/27082455e56eb8e02a01be87d1cf6c5f5b-doppelganger.rdeep-vertical.w245.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=w4KZlZ data-merchant-id=218189 data-track-name="The Fraud, by Zadie Smith (September 5)" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Penguin Press" data-track-price=26 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>The Fraud, by Zadie Smith (September 5)</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$26</span> $29<span> now 10% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$26</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllgxxvlt00413b6xxz6eqbb2@published data-word-count=119>The celebrated author’s first novel since 2016’s Swing Time is a historical tale about class, writing, and gossip that begins with a famously controversial trial. In 1870s England, Eliza Touchet, the housekeeper and cousin to a middling novelist (who happens to be friends with Charles Dickens), becomes obsessed with the Tichborne case — a real-life court drama, relentlessly covered by London newspapers at the time, in which a poor man claimed to be the heir to a massive fortune who had supposedly died in a shipwreck. More than the suspected fraud himself, the abolitionist Eliza is captivated by the trial’s main witness: a man named Andrew Bogle who was enslaved for years on a plantation in Jamaica. &nbsp;—Emma Alpern</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=w4KZlZ data-merchant-id=218189 data-track-name="The Fraud, by Zadie Smith (September 5)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=26 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$26</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=w4KZlZ data-merchant-id=218190 data-track-name="The Fraud, by Zadie Smith (September 5)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=29 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$29</span> at Bookshop Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=CV2b1J data-merchant-id=218192 data-track-name="The Vaster Wilds, by Lauren Groff (September 12)" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Riverhead Books" data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fda/c65/4f20593d350c34e88040289c09b6bb3397-glossy.rdeep-vertical.w245.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=CV2b1J data-merchant-id=218192 data-track-name="The Vaster Wilds, by Lauren Groff (September 12)" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Riverhead Books" data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>The Vaster Wilds, by Lauren Groff (September 12)</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$17</span> $28<span> now 39% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$17</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllgy53to004f3b6x274pi6vo@published data-word-count=139>After Matrix, a sexy spin on medieval romance inspired by the 12th-century writings of Marie de France, Lauren Groff revisits her thesis: that much suffering comes from a misreading of Genesis, whereby man dominated the Earth in lieu of caring for it. Except this time she does it through a story described as a “female Robinson Crusoe,” following a servant girl who flees an early-American settlement in Jamestown, Virginia. As she navigates the harshness of nature and violent encounters with Indigenous people, we get flashes into what she’s left behind: her home, her language, and Bess, a child born into her care whom she considered her only family. A revelation about what exactly the girl had to do to escape the plague-infested colony comes at the end, but the flowing prose holds tension and sows mystery on every page.&nbsp;—J.V.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=CV2b1J data-merchant-id=218192 data-track-name="The Vaster Wilds, by Lauren Groff (September 12)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$17</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=CV2b1J data-merchant-id=218191 data-track-name="The Vaster Wilds, by Lauren Groff (September 12)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=28 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$28</span> at Bookshop Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=dcI9mq data-merchant-id=218194 data-track-name="Doppelganger: A Trip Into the Mirror World, by&nbsp;Naomi Klein (September 12)" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Farrar, Straus and Giroux" data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/813/ec3/e0262130450eac9a0f5fe16e41646875f9-Love-in-a-Time-of-Hate.rdeep-vertical.w245.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=dcI9mq data-merchant-id=218194 data-track-name="Doppelganger: A Trip Into the Mirror World, by&nbsp;Naomi Klein (September 12)" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Farrar, Straus and Giroux" data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Doppelganger: A Trip Into the Mirror World, by&nbsp;Naomi Klein (September 12)</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> $30<span> now 50% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$15</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllgy88qu004t3b6xsoip0f46@published data-word-count=75>An extraordinary act of fan service for all of us who enjoy making literary jokes on the internet.

The biography follows the lives and romances of the artists and thinkers who made a name for themselves during this era: from Simone de Beauvoir to Anaïs Nin to Bertolt Brecht. Through a series of vignettes, the work explores how these artists came to prominence and their affairs of both the body and mind — but hovering over it all is the impending catastrophe of war, which brings gravity to the book that balances nicely against its leaping, gossipy opening. As the culture of Europe shifts away from experimentation and play toward large-scale social collapse, the author wrestles with how easily — and disconcertingly — hate can take over a population.&nbsp;—Isle McElroy</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=iC7bXh data-merchant-id=218197 data-track-name="Love in a Time of Hate: Art and Passion in the Shadow of War, by Florian Illies, translated by Simon Pare (September 19)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=iC7bXh data-merchant-id=218198 data-track-name="Love in a Time of Hate: Art and Passion in the Shadow of War, by Florian Illies, translated by Simon Pare (September 19)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=29 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$29</span> at Bookshop Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=OpTcw1 data-merchant-id=218200 data-track-name="Love and Money, Sex and Death, by McKenzie Wark&nbsp;(September 26)" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=Verso data-track-price=24 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b5a/8f0/44600cff87ce6d0f78815e02bf5b1e15f7-our-strangers.rdeep-vertical.w245.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=OpTcw1 data-merchant-id=218200 data-track-name="Love and Money, Sex and Death, by McKenzie Wark&nbsp;(September 26)" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=Verso data-track-price=24 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Love and Money, Sex and Death, by McKenzie Wark&nbsp;(September 26)</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$24</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$24</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllgyj1tr00613b6xrsr8z8ly@published data-word-count=127>The author has carved out a wildly productive 2023. In March, McKenzie Wark released Raving, her book about the underground queer and trans rave scene in New York. Now, her memoir about her childhood in Australia and transitioning later in life appears, written as a series of direct addresses to the women in her life, from mothers to lovers to herself, as she comes to terms with her gender identity. In an address to herself, Wark writes, “You — what do I even remember of you? Our past selves are probably extensively edited editions. Let me see what I can piece together.” The memoir is an attempt to make sense of the edited self and the person who we once were. A portrait of selfhood under construction.&nbsp;—I.M.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=OpTcw1 data-merchant-id=218200 data-track-name="Love and Money, Sex and Death, by McKenzie Wark&nbsp;(September 26)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=24 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$24</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=OpTcw1 data-merchant-id=218199 data-track-name="Love and Money, Sex and Death, by McKenzie Wark&nbsp;(September 26)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=24.95 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$25</span> at Bookshop Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=J4hwpZ data-merchant-id=218202 data-track-name="Land of Milk and Honey, by C.

Now she sets her sights on a dystopian future: In the aftermath of a global environmental disaster, a chef abandons her career in London to join an affluent mountaintop food-research community insulated from the problems plaguing the rest of the world. As she grows closer to her employer and his daughter, she rediscovers her passion for food, for others, and for herself — and learns that the community’s motives go far beyond preparing elaborate meals.

That novel’s much-anticipated follow-up finds Hild a little older and living in a small stronghold of her own — while tensions across England are rising, threatening all sense of order.

He was notoriously prickly toward journalists, and his body of work actively resists interpretation. For this big new biography of the Velvet Underground front man, Will Hermes — longtime rock journalist and author of Love Goes to Buildings on Fire — threads the needle with a wealth of reporting, access to the entirety of the New York Public Library’s Reed archive, and a nuanced understanding of the man, who was less ahead of his time than apart from it.

In one memorable chapter, a flight of public stairs becomes the stage for a series of passing figures who race up them, sit on them, or “descend together like a bubbling hive.” &nbsp;—E.A.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=RTrnSi data-merchant-id=218213 data-track-name="Roman Stories, by Jhumpa Lahiri&nbsp;(October 10)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=RTrnSi data-merchant-id=218212 data-track-name="Roman Stories, by Jhumpa Lahiri&nbsp;(October 10)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=27 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$27</span> at Bookshop Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=7MBn5b data-merchant-id=218217 data-track-name="Tremor, by Teju Cole&nbsp;(October 17)" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House" data-track-price=21 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ec0/ebb/f8c0cde7317c7095b9fd4f59830169c609-Let-Us-Descend.rdeep-vertical.w245.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=7MBn5b data-merchant-id=218217 data-track-name="Tremor, by Teju Cole&nbsp;(October 17)" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House" data-track-price=21 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Tremor, by Teju Cole&nbsp;(October 17)</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$21</span> $28<span> now 25% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$21</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllh0z2m9009f3b6xgr6dr7f8@published data-word-count=109>On an antiquing trip through New England with his wife, a photography professor named Tunde notices two objects: an elegant antelope headdress made by the West African Bambara people and a photocopied note describing a Native American attack that took place in the 1700s. From there, Tunde’s thoughts spin out — to his teenage years in Nigeria (where parts of the book take place), the brutality of history, and the American “fever dream of mindless Indian violence.” Cole has written plenty of essays in recent years, many of them about photography; this is his first novel since 2011’s Open City, and it shares that book’s heady elliptical style. &nbsp;—E.A.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=7MBn5b data-merchant-id=218217 data-track-name="Tremor, by Teju Cole&nbsp;(October 17)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=21 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$21</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=7MBn5b data-merchant-id=218216 data-track-name="Tremor, by Teju Cole&nbsp;(October 17)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=28 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$28</span> at Bookshop Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=1ukGDp data-merchant-id=218218 data-track-name="Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind, by Molly McGhee&nbsp;(October 17)" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Astra House" data-track-price=23 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/360/5a7/519f4e4b0a4518665f7943efcc33669852-comedy-book.rdeep-vertical.w245.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=1ukGDp data-merchant-id=218218 data-track-name="Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind, by Molly McGhee&nbsp;(October 17)" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Astra House" data-track-price=23 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind, by Molly McGhee&nbsp;(October 17)</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$23</span> $27<span> now 15% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$23</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllh16pvt00a43b6xsp1bba5h@published data-word-count=104>In this debut novel, Abernathy, a self-proclaimed loser, lands a job entering the minds of white-collar workers to remove anxieties from their subconscious. The gig seems like his big break, a way for him to escape mountains of debt and remake his life, possibly even find love. But it’s morally compromising, and he finds it increasingly difficult to separate work from life, dreams from reality. McGhee grapples skillfully with the complicated ethical questions at the core of late-stage capitalism. How much of yourself must you sacrifice in order to make a life?

In this new collection, he continues his practice of modernizing the classical poetic form of the tanka, a five-line, 5-7-5-7-7 syllable poem that he instead writes in one line. His work is stark and sensuous: “Already my body is tired out with desire/Probably so is my soul,” he writes in “Bathhouse.” In “Treetop Flowers,” he captures the coy directness of desire: “All the flowers called flowers scatter/The naked mariner spreads the/Sails of his boat to the island of love.” Hiroaki Sato’s brilliant translation maintains Ishii’s innovations, including the poet’s nontraditional use of punctuation. This collection is an excellent introduction to the beauty of Ishii’s verse.&nbsp;—I.M.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=ZFp3bP data-merchant-id=218225 data-track-name="Bathhouse and Other Tanka, by ­Tatsuhiko Ishii, translated by Hiroaki Sato&nbsp;(November 7)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=ZFp3bP data-merchant-id=218224 data-track-name="Bathhouse and Other Tanka, by ­Tatsuhiko Ishii, translated by Hiroaki Sato&nbsp;(November 7)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=17.95 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> at Bookshop Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=kRleYT data-merchant-id=218226 data-track-name="Same Bed Different Dreams, by Ed Park (November 7)" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House" data-track-price=25 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/bb3/27e/d1ba9d2c59392c599bf498858be6915c3b-the-new-naturals.rdeep-vertical.w245.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=kRleYT data-merchant-id=218226 data-track-name="Same Bed Different Dreams, by Ed Park (November 7)" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House" data-track-price=25 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Same Bed Different Dreams, by Ed Park (November 7)</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$25</span> $30<span> now 17% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$25</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllh1sy38002v3b6xr3bawkiv@published data-word-count=121>When Park’s new novel was pitched to me as “Squid Game meets Gravity’s Rainbow,” suffice to say I was intrigued.

What begins as a fantasy soon becomes reality when a wealthy benefactor helps bankroll the community’s construction and outsiders begin to show up. But as the numbers accumulate, so do the concerns. No ­utopia can avoid conflict for long. &nbsp;—I.M.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=KfwQhv data-merchant-id=218231 data-track-name="The New Naturals, by Gabriel Bump&nbsp;(November 14)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=22 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$22</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=KfwQhv data-merchant-id=218230 data-track-name="The New Naturals, by Gabriel Bump&nbsp;(November 14)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=27 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$27</span> at Bookshop Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=VNjivj data-merchant-id=218233 data-track-name="The Book of Ayn, by Lexi Freiman&nbsp;(November 14)" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=Catapult data-track-price=26 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=VNjivj data-merchant-id=218233 data-track-name="The Book of Ayn, by Lexi Freiman&nbsp;(November 14)" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=Catapult data-track-price=26 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>The Book of Ayn, by Lexi Freiman&nbsp;(November 14)</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$26</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$26</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllh23s8e004b3b6x4ic0iosx@published data-word-count=127>Anna, a 39-year-old writer living in New York, has been canceled. A New York Times reviewer deemed her satirical novel about the opioid epidemic classist, and her publisher drops her, Twitter attacks her, and she’s suddenly overwhelmingly disliked. Full of despair but not at all remorseful, she finds herself ushered into a new world populated by belligerent centrists and edgelord podcast hosts. Most significantly, she discovers a group of Ayn Rand superfans and decides to devote herself to the infamous advocate for unfettered egoism. Anna’s newfound passion for objectivism takes her all the way to Hollywood — at least for a while, until she loses her grip on things again. Freiman’s novel (her second after 2018’s Inappropriation) is uncomfortably funny and sure to cause a stir. &nbsp;—E.A.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=VNjivj data-merchant-id=218233 data-track-name="The Book of Ayn, by Lexi Freiman&nbsp;(November 14)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=26 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$26</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=VNjivj data-merchant-id=218232 data-track-name="The Book of Ayn, by Lexi Freiman&nbsp;(November 14)" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=27 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$27</span> at Bookshop Buy</a><p class=subscriber-copy>Thank you for subscribing and supporting our journalism<span id=givenName></span>.
