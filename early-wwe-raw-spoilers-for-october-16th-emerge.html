The company is rolling through Oklahoma City this week for RAW, and now we know a bit more about what to expect.</p><p>BWE posted behind their private X account to drop a few spoilers. It was also noted that WWE may book a <a href=#>big women’s match for Crown Jewel</a>, and that could be announced tonight.</p><p>A few more spoilers for tonight’s episode of WWE RAW were also posted. We will have to see what else comes out before the show, but it appears that they have some building to do.</p><p>The bona fide WWE insider noted that, “Sami Zayn will not have a good night. His story starts strong.” Only time will tell what WWE does with Sami Zayn following Kevin Owens’ trade to SmackDown.</p><p>The spoiler posts also noted that, Becky Lynch will “find herself in front of the new acquisition.” As NXT Women’s Champion, she is certainly a fighting champion. The Man is also prone to bring her title along with her on RAW.</p><p>WWE’s ‘season premiere’ of Monday Night RAW airs tonight on the USA Network and brings with it two title matches. The card for the evening is already set to include the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship bout, where Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso defend their title against Damian Priest and Finn Balor. Additionally, GUNTHER puts his Intercontinental Championship on the line against Bronson Reed.</p><p>The night will also feature a Falls Count Anywhere match between Ricochet and Shinsuke Nakamura, Rhea Ripley taking on Shayna Baszler, and a clash between Piper Niven and Natalya.</p><p>We will have more coverage of WWE RAW, right before the show, and even afterward, right here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>. We will have more updates, so keep checking back for more coverage. Also, we will have live play-by-play coverage at 8PM ET at our <a href=#>WWE RAW Results</a> hub.</p><p>What’s your take on these early spoilers for WWE RAW this week?
