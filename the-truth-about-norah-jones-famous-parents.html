Ravi Shankar (pictured above right), a "sitar virtuoso and composer" who "created a passion" for "classical Indian music," as <a href=#>The New York Times</a> described, was reportedly 59 and had a son with his first wife,&nbsp;Annapurna Devi, at the time of Jones' birth.</p><p>Despite <a href=#>Shankar's impressive resume</a> (he was a <a href=#>mentor to The Beatles' George Harrison</a>, to list one accomplishment), Jones was tight-lipped about her dad.&nbsp;"I don't like talking about him because he doesn't have anything to do with me or my music," she revealed to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> in 2004. The "Shoot the Moon" singer had provided context for this in 2002, telling <a href=#>The&nbsp;Guardian</a>, "Although I love my dad very much, I did only spend a fraction of my adolescence around him. This is probably why I try to downplay our relationship in the press."</p><p><a href=#>Shankar died in 2012</a> at age 92, with Jones stating about the death, per&nbsp;<a href=#>NME</a>, "My dad's music touched millions of people. He will be greatly missed by me and music lovers everywhere." Before Shankar's death, the musician&nbsp;<a href=#>told</a> Oprah Winfrey in 2003 that she and her dad had "gotten close in the last five years."</p><p>As for Sue, her bond with Jones is strong.&nbsp;"We talk every day on the phone, no matter what," the singer relayed to Winfrey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2lmbIFxe9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2jvLOtx2ahqKaVqHqnrcyorKxloJa%2FprrTrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
