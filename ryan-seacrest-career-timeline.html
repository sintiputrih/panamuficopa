Radio certainly laid the foundation for my comfort on television. Radio has become an extension of me. I’ve always wanted to do both radio and TV.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The star said he’s always had a passion for radio, ever since he was young. <span class=credit>NBCUniversal via Getty Images</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More gameshows, 1997</h2><p>In 1997, Seacrest hosted the short-lived Y2K-friendly game show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Click,”</a> which ran for two seasons.</p><p>Teenagers answered questions about the internet as they competed for a cash prize.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">He hosted a gameshow in 1997 called “Click,” which was geared toward teens. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘American Idol,’ 2002</h2><p>Seacrest truly became a household name in 2002, when he was tasked with co-hosting the now-hit singing competition show “American Idol.”</p><p>For the show’s first season, he co-hosted with comedian Brian Dunkleman, as singers auditioned for a group of judges — at the time, it was music exec Simon Cowell, singer and choreographer Paula Abdul, and record producer Randy Jackson.

I would love to audition to be the host.’ And so I auditioned eventually to be the host. And I got the job.

I think the idea for us is just to create a big party for people who don’t want to go anywhere, who want to just relax, be in their homes, be with their families, order pizza, order buffalo wings, whatever it is.”</p><p>He continued, “We can bring the excitement, the energy and the new year to them. That’s what Dick told me all along.
