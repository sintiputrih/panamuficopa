After <b>Madonna</b> exposed 17-year-old <b>Josephine Georgiou</b>’s breast during her Thursday, March 17, Rebel Heart Tour stop in Brisbane, Australia, the young Aussie defended the superstar’s actions in an interview with <i><a href=#>The Courier Mail</a></i>.</p><p>While critics suggested that Georgiou sue Madonna for pulling down her top in front of thousands during the show at Brisbane Entertainment Centre, the aspiring model insisted she has no plans to press charges on the pop queen.</p><p>“Seriously, why would I sue Madonna for the best moment of my life?” she said. “It was the best night. She was calling me a Victoria’s Secret model the whole time I was onstage, which was so flattering.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Georgiou went on to explain that she was not embarrassed one bit by the unexpected nip slip. “Only I get to decide if I’m humiliated or not — why would people assume I am humiliated by my own breast, nipple or body?” she said. “I didn’t realize my boob was such a big deal — it was nothing to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/madonna-inline-2564b0a1-a43b-4808-ba31-23691f05b1bb.jpg><p>Georgiou’s mother, Toni, took to Facebook to reiterate that her daughter was happy to be touched by the “Living for Love” songstress.</p><p>“Just so everyone knows, Josephine wasn’t ‘humiliated’ like the media are reporting,” she wrote. “She was thrilled to bits and had the time of her life #rebelheart #bitchimmadonna.”</p><p>As previously reported, Madonna invited Georgiou to join her onstage to dance to her hit “Bitch I’m Madonna.” (Throughout her world tour, Madonna has similarly yanked audience members onstage during that segment; some of the more famous guests have included <b>Anderson Cooper</b>, <b>Katy Perry</b>, <b>Amy Schumer</b> and <b>Rita Ora</b>.)</p><p>“She’s the kind of girl you just want to slap on the ass,” the entertainer said before pulling on the teenager’s strapless corset top. When Madge realized her tiny tug resulted in a wardrobe malfunction, she gave a cheeky response.</p><p>“Oh s–t,” she said. “Oh, sorry, sexual harassment. You can do the same to me if you like.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnZWjeri0zqycZpqimq60wIywmKxlla29sL%2FEnWSbsV2irqW7zaeYZpmkYsCpu9ZmmZ6rpGK7qrPHrWSwaWZsg3WAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
