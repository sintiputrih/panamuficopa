I’ve seen other people, and he still is like, ‘This hasn’t happened.’”</p><p>She explained: “So for me, it’s just like <a href=#>I don’t really trust him that much</a>, but for some reason I really do trust him on this just because we’ve broken up and time has gone by and it’s like, ‘Why? What’s the point now?’” Maddi confessed. “I might never know, and I got to be OK with that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Southern-Hospitality-s-Maddi-Reese-Doesn-t-Believe-Trevor-Cheated-in-Season-2-%E2%80%94-But-They-Still-Split-294.jpg><p>Maddi and Trevor had an on-off relationship going into season 2 of <a href=#>Southern Hospitality</a>. When the season began, Maddi had forgiven Trevor for cheating on her in the past and they were back together.</p><p>However, <strong>Bradley Carter</strong> claimed during the season 2 premiere, which aired in December 2023, that Trevor kissed a girl named <strong>Sammie</strong> when he was living with Maddi. Maddi didn’t believe Bradley’s claim — and during Thursday’s season 2 finale, she confronted Sammie for allegedly lying about hooking up with Trevor <a href=#>to stir the pot</a>.</p><p>“I’ve heard all I’ve need to hear from you. You’re a f–king liar,” Maddi told Sammie during a going away party for <strong>Will Kulp</strong>. “Have a great day. Bye, bitch!”</p><p>Maddi locked Sammie out of the house but later revealed <a href=#>she’d heard Sammie’s confession</a> while listening to her and Trevor’s phone call. The revelation shocked Maddi’s friends, who thought she only heard a snippet of Trevor and Sammie’s call.</p><p>“I felt like it wasn’t my rumor. It wasn’t my fight,” Maddi told Us on Thursday as to why she didn’t tell everyone about the recording. “I feel like for me, after hearing what she had to say, that was a chapter closed for me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Southern-Hospitality-s-Maddi-Reese-Doesn-t-Believe-Trevor-Cheated-in-Season-2-%E2%80%94-But-They-Still-Split-293.jpg><p>Maddi further explained that her relationship with Trevor “ended more so because of the stress and the mental stuff I was going through,” but her ex-boyfriend didn’t help himself with all the Sammie drama.</p><p>“I understand that his fingerprints are all over that. But ultimately, I wanted to know [the truth],” she revealed to Us, confirming she was on the call when Trevor confronted Sammie about the rumors. “I feel like I was playing detective in a way, but I felt like it wasn’t my fight. I felt like it was Trevor’s and his decision to go to the group with that.”</p><p>Maddi insisted that it was her own personal struggles with Trevor that led to their split in July 2023. “We have different lifestyles. I work in nightlife. He’s more a nine to fiver,” she said. “I feel like it was very mutual.”</p><p>The DJ added that she is still “moving slowly” out of her and Trevor’s shared home. “I am open to dating and putting myself out there. I feel like I still have some things to heal though,” she said.</p><p>Maddi claimed that the “chapter is closed” between her and Trevor, but it’s not always easy to stay away from him. “You need to have the self-control to be like, ‘Nope, chapter’s closed,’” she teased. “So for me right now, it’s completely closed, but you never know where your future [will go].”</p><p>The door is also closed on Maddi’s relationship with Sammie following their fight during the season 2 finale. “She’s totally gone,” Maddi said of Sammie, confirming they have not spoken since filming the 4th of July bash for the show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I definitely feel like I’m in a healing place, but I’m super open-minded to what else is out there for me,” Maddi told Us of her current headspace. “I’m really just trying to get a lot of the relationships <a href=#>that have been broken</a>. I’ve been really trying to get them back on track.”</p><p>Southern Hospitality’s season 2 reunion airs on Bravo Thursday, February 22, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6hsV2ovLbAx56pp2WYpMCxtdOao6Ksqah6rq3DnaBmqpWawKZ5wZ6jop2mmsBusddmq6udpqS%2FbrDInaWtZZOdsqLAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
