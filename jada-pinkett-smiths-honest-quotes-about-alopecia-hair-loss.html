Jane </i>sequel</a>, seemingly referencing her shaved head. While Pinkett Smith simply rolled her eyes during the&nbsp;March 2022&nbsp;awards show, the&nbsp;<i>Grown Ups&nbsp;</i>actor’s quip&nbsp;<a href=#>sparked a strong reaction from her husband</a>, <a href=#><strong>Will Smith</strong></a>, who appeared to <a href=#>slap Rock in the face on stage</a>. When he returned to his seat, he shouted at Rock, “Leave my wife’s name out of your f—king mouth.”</p><p class=p1>Pinkett Smith <a href=#>embraced her hair condition&nbsp;on the Academy Awards&nbsp;red carpet</a> alongside the <i>King Richard </i>star, who<a href=#> took home the trophy for Best Actor</a> that night. However, it wasn’t the first time she’s been vocal about her&nbsp;experience.</p><p class=p1>“It was terrifying when it first started,” the Maryland native&nbsp;recalled of&nbsp;her “issues” during a May 2018 episode of her Facebook&nbsp;Watch series,&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Red Table Talk</i></a>. “I was in the shower one day and had just handfuls of hair in my hands and I was just like, ‘Oh, my God, am I going bald?’”</p><p class=p1>The <i>Gotham </i>actress explained that she had been wearing a turban to cover up her&nbsp;hair loss, revealing that <a href=#>it was not been an “easy”&nbsp;topic to discuss</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It was one of those times in my life where I was literally shaking with fear,” the&nbsp;<i>Matrix Revolutions&nbsp;</i>star told her mother, <a href=#><strong>Adrienne Banfield Norris</strong></a>, and daughter <a href=#><strong>Willow Smith</strong></a>. “That’s why I cut my hair — and why I continue to cut it. I just had [thought], ‘OK, I think <a href=#>we’re gonna do another layer of cutting</a>,’ you know? And <a href=#>my hair has been a big part of me</a>. Taking care of my hair has been a beautiful ritual, you know? And having the choice to have hair or not, and then one day to be like, ‘Oh, my God, I might not have the choice.’”</p><p class=p1>Alopecia is a condition that&nbsp;<a href=#>can affect&nbsp;an&nbsp;individual’s scalp or entire body</a> and can either be temporary or permanent, per a description from the <a href=#>Mayo Clinic</a>. It is often the result of&nbsp;genetics, hormonal changes, medical conditions or aging. Signs include gradual&nbsp;hair&nbsp;thinning, patchy spots or sudden loosening of hair.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Madagascar&nbsp;</i>voice actress — <a href=#>who married&nbsp;Smith in 1997</a> — made headlines&nbsp;in December 2021&nbsp;when she completely shaved her head.</p><p class=p1>“Now, at this point, I can only laugh,” Pinkett Smith said in an <a href=#>Instagram</a> video at the time. “Y’all know <a href=#>I’ve been struggling with alopecia</a> and just all of a sudden one day, look at this line right here. Look at that.&nbsp;So it just showed up like that and this is going to be a little bit more difficult for me to hide. So I thought I’d just share it so y’all are not asking any questions.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>She added: “But you know mama’s going to put some rhinestones in there. I’m going to make me a little crown.
