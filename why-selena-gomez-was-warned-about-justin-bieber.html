"They have both grown up tremendously and think that this is their time to get back to where they were before," a source close to the pair told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;at the time. However, news of the reunion was not met with the support that Jelena may have hoped for. In particular, the insider noted that those close to the "Lose You To Love Me" singer weren't thrilled to hear that she was back with Bieber. Taylor Swift felt "[Gomez] could do much better," as another insider close to Swift disclosed, and another said that Francia Raisa, who donated her kidney to Gomez, was "not a fan of Bieber after all that Selena and he went through."</p><p>Perhaps their caution was warranted. Though neither Bieber nor Gomez explicitly spoke of infidelity in their earlier relationship, Bieber did allude to a potential lack of faithfulness in a 2015 interview with <a href=#>i-D</a>. "You're on the road. And there are beautiful women on the road. And you're just getting yourself into trouble," he said, after explaining that "people judging [our] relationship through the media" had "messed my head up." Per <a href=#>Elle</a>, Swift seemed to confirm these rumors in 2019 when she 'liked' a Tumblr post that called out Bieber (among other things) for cheating on Gomez.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcHFka313e9ahsGarlaGyr62MoKamnapixKK%2FjLCYq6aVmXqirs6uq2aipajBqrqMm6CempWnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
