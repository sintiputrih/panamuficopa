He followed that up with 109 receiving yards in a loss to the San Francisco 49ers in Week 2. In Week 4, against the Dallas Cowboys, he recorded eight receptions for 132 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=golden-tate-trade></span>Golden Tate Trade<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Giants reportedly sign Golden Tate to four-year, $37.5 million deal two days after trading away Odell Beckham</strong></p><p>In the aftermath of their decision to trade away superstar receiver Odell Beckham, the Giants have insisted that they have a plan without telling us what that plan is. The plan has yet to be revealed, but on Thursday, the Giants did manage to sign one of the best remaining free agents who also happens to play receiver.</p><p><strong>According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Giants are signing Golden Tate to a four-year, $37.5 million deal that includes $23 million guaranteed.</strong></p><p>Tate was the best receiver still available to sign in free agency. And the Giants certainly had a need at the position after dealing Beckham to the Browns.</p><p>In Tate, the Giants are getting one of the league’s best slot receivers who ranks eighth in receptions and 16th in receiving yards since he entered the NFL back in 2010 as a second-round pick of the Seahawks. Tate has since played for the Lions and very briefly — after a midseason trade — for the Eagles. This past season with both teams, he caught 74 passes for 795 yards and four touchdowns. He should help the Giants win slightly more games than they would’ve won without him, but he’s not going to transform them into a surprise playoff team.</p><p>He’s a good player and he deserves to be paid like one, but the signing is still confusing. After trading away Beckham, it certainly looked like the Giants wanted to rebuild. Signing a 30-year-old receiver to a four-year deal signals the opposite approach. Furthermore, while the Giants needed a receiver, they did not need a slot receiver when their only decent receiver, Sterling Shepard, already operates primarily out of the slot.</p><p>From Tate’s perspective, he’s spending what might end up being the last few productive years of his career with a team that isn’t on the verge of competing anytime soon. Then again, if Tate just took the best financial offer, nobody should blame him. At 30, this is likely the last big contract Tate will command.</p><p>In the end, the Giants got better by signing Tate, Tate got paid, and the best receiver available is no longer a free agent. That much is clear.</p><p><strong>The Giants’ plan? Still not clear.</strong></p><p>They’ve said they want to win, but they just traded away their best player less than a year after they gave him a huge contract. They should be rebuilding, but they just signed a 30-year-old receiver who might help them win just enough games to spoil their chances of winding up with the top pick in next year’s draft — a receiver who will likely be past his prime by the time the Giants are ready to compete again with a quarterback not named Eli Manning.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=golden-tate-patriots></span>Golden Tate Patriots<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>WR Golden Tate ‘would love’ to be a Patriot</strong></p><p><strong>INDIANAPOLIS — Over the years there have been rumors of veteran wide receiver Golden Tate as a possible option for the Patriots.</strong></p><p>Now, the soon-to-be-free agent has made it clear he’d be open to turning those rumors into reality, that the possibility of joining New England and catching passes from Tom Brady is enticing to him at this point in his career.</p><p>“I would love it. I would love it,” Tate said on the ProStyle podcast via WEEI.com. “That organization, they have proven to be champions year-in and year-out. They work hard for sure, but you know where you’re going to be at the end of the season: you’re going to be not only looking at the playoffs, but you’re looking at maybe a first-round bye with this team. You gotta admire that organization, they do things right, they’ve been doing it for a long, long, long time.”</p><p><strong>Tate feels like he already has some insight into what life in Foxborough would be like.</strong></p><p>“I would definitely love being a part of something like that and catch a few passes from old Tommy Boy,” Tate added. “Julian [Edelman] is a buddy of mine, I’m really good buddies with him. I’ve heard good things from Kyle Van Noy, who got traded from Detroit and went there and has just been balling out since. It’s, as I said, a great organization. I definitely would not mind going over there for sure.”</p><p>The 30-year-old Tate, who’s played with the Seahawks, Lions, and Eagles, also made it clear that he’d like to add another Super Bowl ring to his collection. He enjoyed big game glory with Seattle and clearly signing with a Patriots team that’s played in three straight Super Bowls – winning two – would give Tate another chance at a championship.</p><p>While Tate sounds open to joining the Patriots, New England certainly has a need at the wide receiver position this offseason with Edelman the only returning option under contract for 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=golden-tate-steelers></span>Golden Tate Steelers<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Golden Tate reportedly choosing between Steelers, Patriots</strong></p><p><strong>He has narrowed his next NFL team down to the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport is reporting.</strong></p><p>Over the weekend, hours before the Steelers agreed to traded Antonio Brown to the Oakland Raiders for third and fifth round picks, Tate publicly expressed his interest in joining the Steelers, who reportedly signed fellow receiver Donte Moncrief to a two-year deal on Wednesday night. Pittsburgh also signed receiver Eli Rogers to a two-year deal on Thursday.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=golden-tate-giants></span>Golden Tate Giants<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Giants agree to terms with receiver Golden Tate</strong></p><p>One day after parting ways with Odell Beckham Jr., the New York Giants are welcoming a new wide receiver to East Rutherford.</p><p>The Giants agreed to terms with former Detroit Lions and Philadelphia Eagles receiver Golden Tate on a four-year, $37.5 million deal with $23 million fully guaranteed, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Thursday.</p><p>The top free-agent wide receiver available according to NFL.com, Tate split time last year with Detroit and Philly, totaling 74 catches on 113 targets for 795 receiving yards and four touchdowns in 15 games with both clubs. This will be Tate’s fourth team as he enters his 10th season in the league.</p><p>By joining the G-Men just over 24 hours after the organization’s divisive trade of Beckham to the Cleveland Browns became official, Tate will inevitably see his production with an impact on the Giants compared, rightly or wrongly, to that of OBJ’s. But the two are wildly different receivers.</p><p>Tate is a YAC master with a knack for big plays starting within five yards of the line of scrimmage; he has never exceeded more than seven touchdowns in a season. Beckham was a highlight-reel freak with field-stretching ability and prowess in the red zone; OBJ hauled in 35 touchdowns in his first three years in the league.</p><p>When Giants general manager Dave Gettleman insisted in the team’s parting message to Beckham that the organization had a plan, the acquisition of a possession receiver like Tate was probably the first step to recovery. It’s no secret that Eli Manning doesn’t have the arm strength or downfield accuracy he once had, making Beckham’s game-breaking abilities less of a threat as time wore on.</p><p>The organization’s commitment to Manning has necessitated, in the front office’s mind, a change in philosophy on offense, prioritizing the running game led by NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Saquon Barkley and possession receiving.</p><p>Whether this bet against Beckham and on Tate pays off remains to be seen. Salary-wise, the Giants passed up paying OBJ up to $90 million over five years to pay Tate less than half of that for four years, plus $16 million in dead cap owed to Beckham. So, Tate, 30, is a cheaper option, but obviously not the talent that Beckham, 26, is.</p><p>Despite the loss of Beckham, New York still boasts a promising crop of skill-position players in Tate, Barkley, wide receiver Sterling Shepard and tight end Evan Engram.</p><p>The question remains: Can Manning orchestrate that quartet to a tune that will drown out fans’ cries for Beckham, or will the wideout’s specter haunt New York for years to come?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BfobGmuoytmK2dXZe2sHnAoJxmnpGitq3FjLCgn51do7K1edaoqa2gXZa7pXnCqKWtqpGYwW5%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
