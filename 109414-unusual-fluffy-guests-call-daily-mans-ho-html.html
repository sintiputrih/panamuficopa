Bears lose their natural fear of humans, and humans forget that bears are unpredictable predators - a perfect formula for disaster.</p><p><h3 class=ih>NEVER RUN FROM A BEAR</h3></p><p class=dh>Though big and placid looking, bears are ferocious and voracious predators. Something that runs away - human or animal - becomes an irresistible prey and a bear will give chase. A human cannot outrun a bear who can match a racehorse's speed running downhill or uphill. If confronted by a bear, people are advised to step away sideways.</p><p class=dh>While getting away from a bear, people should remember that climbing a tree is not a good idea. Bears are excellent climbers.</p><p class=dh>Most bear/human interactions end amicably, as long as people follow the guidelines and treat the animals with respect and avoid confrontations with adults accompanied by cubs.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>In a related story</a>, a mother bear and her cubs turn a pool in a Rockaway Township, New Jersey backyard into their own private playground.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpncmxhaXq2utSsrJqkXZu5trLFsmSgrZWowbR5wpqjpWWUlratxYymmKerXZ28b7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
