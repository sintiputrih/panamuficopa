During the drama-fueled “Women Tell All” special following Zach Shallcross’s season of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a>, it was revealed that former frontrunner Charity Lawson would get another shot at everlasting love.</p><p>And in the Season 20 premiere of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, she gets a little help from one of her family members to find out who is there for the right (and wrong) reasons.</p><p>That’s right — Charity’s older brother, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nehemiah Lawson</a> — whom we met during Bachelor hometowns — helps his sister find Mr. Right on her season. So, who is he? We have all the details as viewers clamor to find out more about him after The Bachelorette premiere.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Charity’s brother from ‘The Bachelorette’?</h2><p>The new Bachelorette is one of three children to <a href=#>parents David and Vickie Lawson</a>. Charity has two siblings, sister Amiyaka and brother Nehemiah — and her elder brother goes undercover in Season 20 of The Bachelorette to help his younger sister weed out any men who go on the show for the wrong reasons.</p><p>Fans first met Charity’s brother Nehemiah during hometown visits on Zach Shallcross’s season of The Bachelor and quickly learned that he would do anything for his sibling.</p><p>As her older brother, his overprotective nature was understandable, but Charity often refers to him as her "best friend" too. And now Nehemiah is taking on the challenge of assisting Charity on The Bachelorette.</p><p>So, who is Nehemiah Lawson, and what does he do for a living?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What does Charity’s brother do for a living?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dr. Nehemiah Lawson (@_thesingingdentist)</a></p></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nehemiah’s LinkedIn profile</a>, he is a pediatric dentist based in Charlotte, N.C.</p><p>After holding several pediatric dental residency roles at Texas A&M’s College of Dentistry, Scottish Rite for Children, and Children’s Health, he became a full-time pediatric dentist at SouthPark Pediatric Dentistry in Charlotte. Nehemiah has worked at SouthPark since June 2021.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where did Charity’s brother, Nehemiah, go to school?</h2><p>Nehemiah Lawson’s educational background is incredibly impressive. He attended the University of Georgia and obtained a B.A. in Theater and a B.S. in Biology with an emphasis in Neuroscience.</p><p>In 2019, Nehemiah pursued his Postdoctoral Specialty Certificate in Pediatric Dentistry / Periodontics from Texas A&M’s School of Dentistry.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m literally only here for Charity’s brother and then I’m out <a href=#>#TheBachelorette</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oi4ecdyXYi</a></p>— not bored just burntout (@burntoutpremed) <a href=#>June 27, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">How long is Nehemiah on 'The Bachelorette'?</h2><p>Obviously the most important question on viewers' minds is whether or not Nehemiah is here to stay on Charity's season. He puts on a disguise in the premiere to go undercover as a bartender and get to know the guys so he can report back to Charity.</p><p>However, it doesn't look like he's here to don a collection of hair pieces, glasses, and fake noses to do the same thing all season — as much as fans would love to see him infiltrate the guys' cocktail parties on the regular. Still, there's a strong possibility Nehemiah will pop in again when his sister needs him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>charity’s brother watched an episode of thats so raven and knew what he had to do in that mansion<a href=#>#bachelorette</a> <a href=#>#thebachelorette</a> <a href=#>#bachelornation</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HwbdIBxRPs</a></p>— reality juls (@liljulsie) <a href=#>June 27, 2023</a></figure><p>Clearly, Nehemiah isn't afraid of a little hard work.
