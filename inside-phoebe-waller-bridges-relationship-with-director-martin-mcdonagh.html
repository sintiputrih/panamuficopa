They also "exchanged a quick peck" when McDonagh won at the 2018 Golden Globes.</p><p>A profile of Waller-Bridge in the <a href=#>The New York Times</a> the following year acknowledges the relationship, advising the British star is "less inclined" to share in-progress scripts with her boyfriend. Waller-Bridge clarified to <a href=#>The Telegraph</a> that she does show her man her writing "a little bit," but the "Fleabag" creator prefers to keep her work and home lives separate. She's a massive fan of McDonagh's stuff, however, telling <a href=#>The Guardian</a>&nbsp;his play, "The Pillowman," was "the first play I saw that made me think theatre can be really exciting."&nbsp;However, when asked whether this is the happiest relationship she's ever been in, Waller-Bridge was reticent, stating firmly, "I'm not going to talk about that."&nbsp;</p><p>While&nbsp;speaking to <a href=#>Vogue</a>, the "Star Wars" star admitted she finds it much easier to open up through her writing. According to the&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a>,&nbsp;the couple quarantined separately during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Waller-Bridge in London and McDonagh believed to have stateside. A source told The Sun in May 2020 (via the Daily Mail), "Phoebe and Martin have found it hard to stay in touch. It's been tough. Their careers are busy, and they are dragged in different directions."&nbsp; As far as we know, though, the couple is still together. While they've kept their relationship firmly out of the public eye, no official news of a breakup has been confirmed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57k2pscm5kZLavv8idnGaomKSyo7GMsJilpJWneqO%2ByJ2enqtdp7KtrdOipqermJ69bsPIrZ9mnJmnsqTAzqtkppmiqbavecycm6imkZy1cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
