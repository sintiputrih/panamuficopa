Each platform has its own opportunity for revenue, but the seven-figure dollar sign associated with the adult entertainment industry suggests her OnlyFans account is where the big bucks come from.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=548 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>On Oct. 13, Amouranth, whose real name is Kaitlyn Michelle Siragusa, revealed on Twitter that she became aware of a hacker‚Äôs attempt to withdraw money from her OnlyFans account after receiving an error message stating incorrect bank details had been entered. At the time, her OnlyFans account carried $900,000, she explained. The hackers were unsuccessful in their attempt, but Amouranth‚Äôs announcement that she had been sitting on $900,000 sent eyebrows into hairlines as many wondered exactly how much money she makes from OnlyFans.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-amouranth-makes-over-1-million-on-onlyfans-and-she-has-the-receipts-to-prove-it data-injectable=false>Amouranth makes over $1 million on OnlyFans, and she has the receipts to prove it</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>So my main OF account that was carrying a $900k balance not yet withdrawn was hacked last night üò¢üò≥</p><p>This is the notice after they tried to add their own bank info‚Ä¶ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/IUrPTBI6QX</a></p>‚Äî Kaitlyn (@wildkait) <a href=#>October 13, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>While not all content produced on OnlyFans is adult entertainment, a vast majority of it is, and Amouranth falls under that category. The 28 year-old has been open in the past about how much she makes on OnlyFans, but in July 2022 she shared the exact numbers.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>In a screenshot posted to Twitter, Amouranth revealed she makes over a million and a half dollars every month on OnlyFans, with her highest month being Feb. 2022 with $1.6 million. Suddenly that $900,000 sitting in her account at the time of the attempted hack feels like a quarter in the cushion of a couch.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>it's not about the money.<br>It's about sending a message <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Bz2WXoTSAk</a></p>‚Äî Amouranth (@Amouranth) <a href=#>July 8, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about the money,‚Äù she says in the tweet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the message‚Ä¶ In all seriousness, I‚Äôm only able to do this because of the incredible team I‚Äôve built.

As is customary, Amouranth remained silent to the backlash, saving any and all comments for her live streams on Twitch.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=false>In addition to making headlines for her financial success, Amouranth has also recently been in the news following her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shocking allegations of abuse</a> against her husband. Until that point, most of her followers weren‚Äôt aware she even had a husband. Now, a live-streamed video has revealed a heated argument between the pair, one which brought Amouranth to tears and set the internet ablaze with concern.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8pbvErGSapZ%2Bqv6K606Fkq52Robm6ecSaqadln6uys3mQZqSipJyevK95wGakqKaknXqwuoyopaWxlpa7tHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
