The lyrics talk about the intense love Glenn feels for his partner, and how he cannot bear to be separated from her even for a moment. The opening lines of the song "Feels like a fire that burns in my heart, every single moment that we spend apart, I need you around for every day to start, I haven't left you alone" showcase his deep longing and love for his partner. Glenn wants to be with his lover all the time, and being away from her is like a fire burning within him.</p><br><p>The song also talks about how the couple has faced several ups and downs in their relationship, but they have overcome these issues together. In the lines "We fought in a battle, nobody won, and now we face a mountain to be overcome, you can't turn away, the past is said and done, I need us to carry on," the singer talks about how difficult times have brought them together and made their love stronger. They have to face the hurdles together and move on.</p><br><p>In conclusion, the song is all about a deep and passionate love that cannot be defined in words. The singer not only wants to spend time with his partner but fall in love with her again like they did when they first met.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Feels like a fire that burns in my heart</u><br>The separation from you is causing an intense emotional pain in my heart.</p><br><p><u>Every single moment that we spend apart</u><br>The anguish of the separation is persistent and continuous, every minute that we are not together.</p><br><p><u>I need you around for every day to start</u><br>You are the essential ingredient that gives every day life and meaning.</p><br><p><u>I haven't left you alone</u><br>I have not abandoned you, mentally or emotionally. Even though we are apart, my love for you remains constant.</p><br><p><u>There's something about you, I stare in your eyes</u><br>I am captivated by the essence of your being and the depths of your soul when I gaze into your eyes.</p><br><p><u>And everything I'm looking for I seem to find</u><br>You possess all that I have ever desired in a partner and more. All my hopes and expectations are met when I am with you.</p><br><p><u>All this time away is killing me inside</u><br>The time spent apart from you feels like a slow death, as my heart yearns for your presence and touch.</p><br><p><u>I need your love in my life</u><br>Your love is indispensable to my life, and without it, my world is incomplete and meaningless.</p><br><p><u>I wanna spend time till it ends</u><br>I want to cherish every moment with you and continue to do so until the end of time.</p><br><p><u>I wanna fall in you again</u><br>I want to immerse myself completely in your love, just like when we first fell in love.</p><br><p><u>Like we did when we first met</u><br>I want our love to be as passionate and fiery as it was when we first laid eyes on each other.</p><br><p><u>We fought in a battle, nobody won</u><br>Our past conflicts have only resulted in more pain for both of us, and no one can claim victory.</p><br><p><u>And now we face a mountain to be overcome</u><br>We now have a great challenge to overcome, but I am ready to face it with you by my side.</p><br><p><u>You can't turn away, the past is said and done</u><br>We cannot change the past, but we must not let it tear us apart. We have to move forward together.</p><br><p><u>I need us to carry on</u><br>I need us to persevere and stay true to our love for each other, no matter the obstacles in our path.</p><br><p><u>You'll try everything you never thought would work before</u><br>I am willing to try new things and do whatever it takes to keep our love strong and vibrant.</p><br><p><u>When you live, when you love, and you give them your all</u><br>When you truly love someone, you have to be selfless and give everything you have to the relationship.</p><br><p><u>You can always give up some more</u><br>Love requires constant effort and sacrifice. When you think you have given everything, there is always more you can give.</p><br><p><u>Baby nothing means anything unless you're here to share with me</u><br>Without you, everything in my life is meaningless. You are the only one who gives meaning to my life.</p><br><p><u>I can breathe, I can bleed, I can die in my sleep</u><br>With you by my side, I feel alive and whole. Without you, I feel like I am suffocating and fading away.</p><br><p><u>'Cause you're always there in my dreams</u><br>Even when we are apart, you are with me in my dreams and thoughts. Your presence brings me comfort and peace.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Downtown Music Publishing, Peermusic Publishing, Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd.<br>Written by: Walter Afanasieff, Robin Thicke</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maH%2Bcmruvq6uerqKrX5uurbi%2Bmp6aoZ4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
