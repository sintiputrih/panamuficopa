Per his "Judge Jerry" <a href=#>bio</a>, Springer studied at Northwestern University, where he gained a degree in law. Subsequently, he worked as a lawyer at times during his professional life.&nbsp;As "Judge Jerry" was debuting in 2019, Springer was asked about what is required to become a judge in a <a href=#>BUILD Series</a> interview. "Well, I'm a lawyer, so you would have to have that," Springer said. He went on to clarify, "In most of the country, you don't even have to be a lawyer necessarily to be a judge â€” it's an elected office."&nbsp;</p><p>In another interview from 2019, Springer further explained how he dedicated one day toward gaining the proper certification for the title of judge. "There was a day of reviewing how it works. You get special certification, and I'm a lawyer," Springer said, per the <a href=#>New York Post</a>. "You have to be certified [to be a judge]; it's a day thing, and if you're a lawyer it's almost automatic unless you've killed someone." Following this process, Springer was focused on delivering just verdicts on "Judge Jerry."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampnZYB6fI6wmKxlmpq%2Fs8WMrKeroZ6csrN50Z6YpWWaqrGosY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
