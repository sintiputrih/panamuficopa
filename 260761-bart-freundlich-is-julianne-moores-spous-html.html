They started dating shortly after too.</p><p class=Fg>Moore played the role of Mia alongside Scheider and Danner in the movie that chronicled one dysfunctional family's Thanksgiving experience. In an on-stage interview in 2019, Moore narrated the hilarious way she and her director-turned-husband met and hit it off.
