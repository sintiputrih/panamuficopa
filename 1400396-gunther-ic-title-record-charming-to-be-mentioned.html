Honky Tonk Man currently holds the record at 454 days.</p><p>GUNTHER said he doesn’t track statistics, but it’s still nice to be mentioned in those discussions.</p><p>“I mean, it’s great, yeah. I’m not a big stats guy myself when it comes to that, like most matches won, this, that, blah, blah, blah. It’s nothing really for me,” he noted, “but it’s very charming to be in those circles if that makes sense.</p><p>“But yeah, we’ll see. I have to get through Saturday first. I still have a little bit to go until I break that record,” he added. “I’ll focus on that when it’s time. Right now, I’m focused on tomorrow.”</p><p>GUNTHER successfully defended his title against Drew McIntyre at SummerSlam in Detroit. If he makes it to September 9th as champion, he will break the record for the longest Intercontinental title reign of all time. However, he still has one more challenger, Chad Gable, standing in his way.</p><p>Since his title reign began, GUNTHER has been mentioned in fantasy matchups with the likes of Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns. He says being mentioned in that way also shows that he’s doing something successfully.</p><p>“Oh, it does a lot of course. The reason why we do is to entertain the audience,” he said. “When they put you on that level with those names, obviously that’s to boost your confidence and gives you the sign that you’re doing something right.“</p><p>GUNTHER will defend his Intercontinental Championship against Chad Gable on the September 4 episode of WWE RAW.</p><p>Watch our full interview with GUNTHER below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZqKmpJq%2Ft7XEsKpoaWRlfXSFlWaerqaknbKzecicZK2hpKGybr7EnKarnF2YtaK%2BzKKloGWkpHqjsYymnKesmaS7prA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
