His father Eddie Brown was an Arena Football League player, who played as a wide receiver for the Albany Firebirds. Brown attended Miami Norland High School and played a variety of positions like running back, wide receiver, quarterback and punt returner for his High School team. Brown enrolled at North Carolina Prep Tech for one season where he played as a quarterback. He attended and played for Central Michigan University from 2007 to 2009. Brown had also received a scholarship from Florida International University, but he was expelled after having an altercation with the security.</span></p><p><span>He played 14 games in his freshman season and made 102 receptions for 1003 yards along with 6 touchdowns. Brown was the starting wide receiver for Michigan and played every game in his sophomore season. In his final season as a Michigan player, he helped the team set a school record for wins (12). He finished his college career with 305 receptions, 3199 receiving yards and 22 touchdowns.</span></p><h2 id=antonio-brown-1><strong>Who drafted Antonio Brown?</strong></h2><p><span>Brown declared himself for the NFL draft in 2010. He was picked in the 6th round of the 2010 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was the overall pick number 195 of the draft and the second wide receiver pick by the Pittsburgh Steelers after Emmanuel Sanders. Tight end Rob Gronkowski, defensive tackle Geno Atkins, and defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh are some of the notable players of the 2010 NFL Draft.</span></p><h2 id=antonio-brown-2><strong>Antonio Brown’s NFL Journey</strong></h2><p><span>Brown has had a great career from his rookie season in 2010 through 2018. He has amassed more receptions than any other player in the league. Brown made it to Super Bowl XLV during his rookie season with the Steelers. They lost to the Green Bay Packers. In his rookie season, he finished with 16 receptions for 167 yards in 10 games.</span></p><p><span>In his second season with the Steelers, Brown started only three games but he became the first player in NFL history to have more than 1000 receiving and returning yards in the same year.</span></p><p><span>The Steelers extended his contract with a five-year deal worth $42.5 million in 2012.

In his final season with the Steelers, Brown led the league in receiving touchdowns (15). Brown amassed a total of 11,207 receiving yards for the Steelers with 74 receiving touchdowns, in the regular seasons.</span></p><p><span>Brown became dissatisfied with his role in the Steelers team and also had rifts with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Steelers traded Brown to the Oakland Raiders in the 2019 NFL Draft. Brown missed several practice sessions with the Raiders firstly due to frostbites (due to not wearing correct equipment) and later due to him not being allowed to wear his old helmet (which was banned by the NFL due to its specifications). The Raiders released Brown before the start of the season due to his constant altercations and he demanded release after they voided the guaranteed money in his contract.</span></p><p><span>Brown agreed to a one year contract with the New England Patriots worth $15 million and a $9 million signing bonus. There were allegations of sexual misconduct going on against him at that point but he continued to practise with the Patriots. He made a debut for the Patriots in Week 2 of the 2019 NFL season.

He was suspended by the NFL for misrepresenting his COVID-19 status.</span></p><p><span>Brown’s career with the Buccaneers ended when he took off his jersey, shoulder pads, gloves and shirt mid-game against the New York Jets in Week 17 of the 2021 season. He had played 7 games in his last season with 42 catches, 545 receiving yards and 4 touchdowns.
