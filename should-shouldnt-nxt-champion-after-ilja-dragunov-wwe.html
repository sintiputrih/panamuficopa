This was his second shot at the title, after a failed bid at The Great American Bash, making him the first male singles wrestler to win the main titles in both NXT and its now-defunct UK offshoot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED<a href=#>Ilja Dragunov Clinches NXT Championship in Thrilling Victory Over Carmelo Hayes</a></span></p><p>Inevitably, a rematch between the two may soon follow, but either way, there is a long queue of potential challengers to Dragunov's throne. However, only a select few in this have the necessary skills and charisma needed to carry the brand after him...</p><h2 id=should-not-be-carmelo-hayes><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Should Not Be: Carmelo Hayes</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/carmelo-hayes.jpg><p>For almost six months, Carmelo Hayes was HIM - the flagbearer, the gold standard of NXT. His incredible athleticism and unbridled charisma made him a current megastar among future megastars - which was certainly helped by his <a href=#>Raw cameo in July against the Judgment Day</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED<a href=#>10 Things You Need To Know About Carmelo Hayes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That being said, he may be overstaying his welcome in the White and Gold very soon. He has already split (albeit amicably) with his former buddy Trick Williams, and he would be a great fit in whatever faction Bobby Lashley is assembling over on SmackDown. So if he ever gets his rematch, expect him to lose and receive a great sendoff.</p><h2 id=should-be-trick-williams><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Should Be: Trick Williams</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/hayes-and-williams.jpg><p>Speaking of Trick Williams, he has come a long way from his humble beginnings as Carmelo Hayes's bodyguard. Once Melo became the NXT Champion, everyone expected a heel turn, and they did get one - but it was not from Trick, but rather Bron Breakker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Six months in, the former wide receiver has finally validated himself as a singles wrestler, taking Ilja Dragunov to the limit and capturing the NXT North American Championship also at No Mercy - even if the ensuing reign lasted <a href=#>just three days</a>. That signifies WWE's faith in him, and Melo may also want no bigger job than to put over his friend if ever they meet.</p><h2 id=should-not-be-joe-coffey><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Should Not Be: Joe Coffey</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/joe-coffey-Cropped.jpg><p>Ever wonder why Gallus' NXT Tag Team Championship reign is considered <a href=#>a low point</a>? Well, it is because other than being the standard Scottish brawlers, not much about their presentation stands out.</p><p>Leader Joe Coffey is the foremost example of this. While he hits hard and has a very mean mug, he does not have that much charisma. Sure, he and his allies Mark Coffey and Wofgang may be able to prop him up as a brutish ruler whose enforcers strike an imposing figure, bur the point still stands: where is their charm?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-be-noam-dar><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Should Be: Noam Dar</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Noam-Dar.jpg><p>Noam Dar is the exact opposite of Joe Coffey: not exactly the most physically imposing wrestler in the world, but one who has two things going for him: 1) unprecedented technical wrestling skill (as evidenced by his stranglehold on the Heritage Cup since its inception) and 2) an uncanny ability to generate heel heat.</p><p>Just look at him: He screams "jerk who should be hated by all, yet somehow has an equally insufferable entourage". His talking game has to be heard to be believed, and if he actually follows up on some of his most outlandish claims...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-not-be-baron-corbin><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Should Not Be: Baron Corbin</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/baron-corbin-cropped.jpg><p>Baron Corbin's <a href=#>"Lone Wolf 2.0"</a> NXT run may very well become the best of his career. He has had an NXT title challenge, been Gable Steveson's first professional wrestling opponent, and even defeated Bron Breakker and Ilja Dragunov of all people.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED<a href=#>5 Reasons Why Fans Love Baron Corbin (& 5 Reasons Why Fans Dislike Him)</a></span></p><p>However, when you factor in his past, that may be a rather generous take. His career is filled with bad creative direction after bad creative direction, and while it is said that most wrestlers peak in their 30s, he may already be past it - at least creatively. His safe in-ring style may also not cut it with NXT's penchant for outrageous spots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-be-dijak><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Should Be: Dijak</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dijak-entrance-cropped.jpg><p>Remember when Dominik Dijakovic was considered one of the most promising WWE prospects alongside Keith Lee? Then RETRIBUTION happened, and he lost almost all his stock as that stable ate loss after loss - then he became a jobber, both in singles and tags.</p><p>So he went back to NXT - but not as his old self. Rather, it was as the imposing "bringer of justice" Dijak, and it is a great gimmick. The man is on a mission to achieve justice - and winning the NXT Championship is a great way to do that and redeem himself for his horrible past booking. Just ask Mandy Rose.</p><h2 id=should-not-be-joe-gacy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Should Not Be: Joe Gacy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/joe-gacy-cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Schism once aspired to be the next Wyatt Family - a devilish cult leader in Joe Gacy and a group of loyal followers in Ava Raine and the Grizzled Young Veterans, who would be renamed The Dyad. But then it went sideways.</p><p>They lost more big matches than won. Rip Fowler and Jagger Reid wanted out, and they got it - even if it was late. Now Gacy has just Ava beside him, and she could break out on her own soon. That represents another setback in his creative direction - there was already the loss of his muscle Harland, and frankly, he may be closer to a pink slip than he is to the NXT Championship.</p><h2 id=should-be-dragon-lee><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Should Be: Dragon Lee</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dragon-lee-header.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>WWE has been desperate for a successor to Rey Mysterio for quite some time, and late last year it seemingly found the answer to that question in Dragon Lee.</p><p>There have been rumblings about <a href=#>promoting him to the big leagues</a> after a stellar week that saw him appear on all three brands, but here is an unpopular opinion: WWE should not rush it. Why? Rey can still deliver in the ring, as evidenced by his current United States title run and angle with the LWO; and Lee needs to work on the intangibles before being considered for a call-up. Holding the NXT title would be a good indicator.</p><h2 id=should-not-be-bron-breakker><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Should Not Be: Bron Breakker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collage-maker-30-may-2023-03-30-pm-8458.jpg><p>Look, everyone loves Bron Breakker. He has <a href=#>"face of the franchise" potential</a>. He could be the next megastar - the marketability of John Cena stored inside a Roman Reigns-type ex-footballer body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But why is he still trudging his wheels in NXT? Why has he not been called up yet? Instead, he has been losing feud after feud; and losing to Baron Corbin of all people is not a good look.</p><p>And yet he will still get a title shot anyway because of history. Here is hoping he loses and finally gets his introduction to the big leagues.</p><h2 id=should-be-tony-d-39-angelo><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Should Be: Tony D'Angelo</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tony-DAngelo-nxt-debut-mafia-wwe.jpg><p>The Mobster. Everyone's favorite Mafioso. The one and only Tony D'Angelo. Whatever you call him, he has been a favorite among fans for his pseudo-Italian accent and charisma.</p><p>Whenever D'Angelo appears, his angle is always gold. <a href=#>His introduction</a>? "Killing" Two Dimes? Having Legado del Fantasma under his thumb? Fighting Pretty Deadly and Gallus with Stacks? Whatever it is, he has proven himself to be NXT's undisputed king of narratives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, put the main title on him. Suddenly, "business" is good.
