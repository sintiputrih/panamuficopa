Solve the puzzles at the <a href=#>Breakout</a> escape room</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Escape rooms are a convenient option for team-building ideas in Charlotte because they don’t take a lot of planning. Enter Breakout, which has several themed rooms to choose from, like Operation: Casino, Undercover Alley, and Runaway Train. Additionally, they offer specially designed team-building packages, too. Groups of up to 36 players will split up into smaller groups to take turns in the escape rooms. You and your team can also opt to play virtually since that may work better for you all.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Nearly every major US city seems to have an axe-throwing club these days, and Charlotte is no exception. BATL Charlotte LoSo believes that “throwing a killer party should be fun, simple, and full of bullseyes.” And we believe that axe-throwing is a fun way for your team to blow off some steam while competing. In fact, you can book one or more axe-throwing lanes (or the entire venue) for groups from six up to 100 people. Beer and food can be purchased on-site, and you’ll also get a personalized training session to start you off.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Learn to make noodles with the <a href=#>Story of Ramen</a></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Though based in San Francisco, Story of Ramen features virtual ramen cooking classes to delight and inform your Charlotte team. Cooking lessons are a great way to build team spirit, and the Story of Ramen’s hands-on class is a fun two-hour option. You’ll learn to make noodles from scratch and then get to enjoy your bowl of ramen. Additionally, they offer gyoza-making classes and sake-tasting classes, for extra Japanese-inspired fun.</p><p>You can arrange for them to deliver the necessary foodstuffs to you at your office or <a href=#>Peerspace</a> location.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Paint and sip (and sing!) at the <a href=#>City Art Room</a></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>There’s a reason why City Art Room was voted Charlotte’s best team-building venue. It’s versatile and fun! Host a private party at City Art Room and choose from more than 20 art-based activities, such as pottery painting, wood and canvas painting, and karaoke.</p><p>They also offer a unique “Puzzle Painting,” in which each person paints a different piece that fits into a larger image when you’re done. You can book one of their locations in Westend and Boardwalk or have them come to you at a retreat space or <a href=#>Peerspace</a> rental.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>You’re never too old for go-karts, especially at Victory Lane. In fact, the venue boasts 100,000 square feet of space to host your corporate event or team-building outing. Victory Lane Karting includes an arcade, virtual reality options, the Pit Road Bar and Grill, and Gasoline Alley bowling, making it a well-rounded option for a team outing!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Go on a scavenger hunt at <a href=#>Carowinds</a> theme park</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Just a 15-minute drive from the city, Carowinds theme park makes for an exciting team-building idea in Charlotte. In addition to riding the rollercoasters, you can go on an Amazing Race-style scavenger hunt, play a game show, or attend a workshop by Teambonders.
