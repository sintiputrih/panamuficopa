Her housekeeper found her unresponsive in her residence near Calabasas, California. When her ex-husband, Danny Keough got there after dropping the kids off at school, he tried reviving her through CPR.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The paramedics arrived at the scene at 10:37 AM. According to L.A. County Fire Department Capt. Sheila Kelliher, the 54-year-old musician was brought to West Hills Hospital. She was in an induced coma in the ICU. Later on, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner stated that the cause of Lisa's death was actually "undetermined."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar44951835.jpg><p>In 2012, Lisa started suffering from back pain. It caused her to cancel multiple tours. She also struggled with opioid addiction after her doctor gave her a prescription for the pain. On top of that, her family has a history of heart issues. Elvis Presley, as well as his dad, <a href=#>died from heart attacks</a>. "Preliminary autopsy findings" ruled out "cardiac arrhythmia" as the <a href=#>King of Rock and Roll</a>'s cause of death, per Dr. Jerry Francisco, the Shelby County coroner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Lisa's mother, Priscilla</a> was the first to break the news of Lisa's passing. "It is with a heavy heart that I must share the devastating news that my beautiful daughter Lisa Marie has left us," she said in a statement. "She was the most passionate strong and loving woman I have ever known. We ask for privacy as we try to deal with this profound loss.

The two quickly hit it off. After the death of <a href=#>Lisa's ex-husband, Michael Jackson</a> that year, Sarah offered her Marbella Mansion to the Lights Out hitmaker, so she could grieve away from the press.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They grew closer the next year when Lisa and <a href=#>her then-husband, Michael Lockwood</a> moved to England. The couple settled down in a $10 million home in Rotherfield, East Sussex where the former got a job at Mr. Chippy, a local fish and chip van. "It was when she first moved to the village about two years ago," said the owner, Kim Scales. "She is really interested in who people are and wanted to know all about our lives and how we live."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fono3pyxwaelnen.jpeg><p>He continued: "We own the pub and a mobile fish and chip van, but she said she'd never heard of anything like it, and said she wanted to work on it. She got on there with her son, but we were all laughing because not one of the locals realized who it was."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa and Sarah's friendship continued even when the former moved back to the US.

"We look at Priscilla as a mother to Lisa Marie, we look at Lisa Marie and say, 'You lost a son,'" she said of <a href=#>Lisa's son, Benjamin who died in 2020</a>. "Mothers losing children — there are no words for it. So today we talk about action. Action is the way we can go forward, we can light the flame."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued: "So for Riley, for Harper and Finley and the entire family, we march forward in support of you.
