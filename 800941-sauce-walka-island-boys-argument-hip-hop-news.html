In a new clip making its rounds online, Kodiyakredd is seen standing in a jewelry store, with none other than Sauce Walka browsing nearby. They began to argue about which of the two of them had more money and eventually started to exchange insults.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I'm a millionaire. You're not a millionaire, bro," Sauce Walka told the Island Boy. "Bro, I'm way more known," he responded. The situation only escalated from there, though Kodiyakredd didn't say much, insisting that he wasn't willing to argue with the rapper. "Your jewelry's fake, you're a p***y, and I will slap you," Sauce Walka said. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Stop talking to me."</a> Fortunately, some security guards were around to intervene before things got too out of hand. At the time of writing, it remains unclear exactly what prompted the argument.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sauce-walka-threatens-to-slap-kodiyakredd>Sauce Walka Threatens To Slap Kodiyakredd</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It looks as if the two of them are still on bad terms, as they both took to Houston Closet's Instagram comments section <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">to throw some final jabs</a>. "[Lollipop emoji] Boy," Sauce Walka wrote. Kodiyakredd later chimed in with, "He did sho the part where I came out running and threw plants on Sauce." This isn't the first time the Island Boys have found themselves in a disagreement that almost turned physical, however.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Back in February, they sat down for an interview when they were asked about kissing each other in a viral video. They didn't take kindly to the question, threatening to break things in the studio and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">nearly starting a fight</a>.
