The model, 33, took <i><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>’</i>s lie detector test on October 25 and insisted that she “actually really love[s]” Kim.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I grew up watching <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i>, and I actually liked it before they were even cool,” Julia said. “And when people would bash her, I would always go to bat for her. And I thought she f***ing killed it in<i> American Horror Story,</i> so she is a multi-talented queen.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>After the interviewer asked whether or not Julia thought Kim was “inspired” by her, the <i>Down the Drain</i> author replied, “I would say there have been some [fashion] looks that are a little similar to mine, but I feel like, you know, it’s just what’s trending. But I don’t know if I’m, like, on her mood board or anything like that.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Earlier this month, Julia’s book made headlines for her bombshell revelations about her relationship with Ye, 46. While detailing the moment she and Ye broke up, Julia claimed that the rapper said he “discovered a lot of information” about her during a phone call with Kim. Ye then allegedly told Julia he “didn’t know [that she was] a drug addict.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The <i>Uncut Gems</i> actress claimed that she told Ye, “I told you! Maybe if you listened more. And not to mention, so were you!” Julia also described her drug addiction throughout the memoir.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Upon splitting from the “Jesus Walks” artist, Julia wrote in her book that she told her publicist to inform the press that her relationship with Ye was over. However, he allegedly sent her texts and made multiple calls demanding her to sign an NDA. When she refused, Ye allegedly texted her, “I can’t be friends with you if you don’t sign it,” to which she replied, “I’ll live.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>As for Kim, the SKKN founder filed for divorce from the “Stronger” rapper in 2021. However, they didn’t finalize their divorce until the end of 2022 after Ye went on multiple public tirades about their separation. Not only that, but he also stirred up controversy after he repeatedly attacked Kim’s boyfriend at the time, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Pete Davidson</b></a>, on social media. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>During Julia’s <i>Vanity Fair </i>interview, she noted that “anyone” could benefit from being a dominatrix, including comedians. (Julia is a former dominatrix) The runway star was subsequently handed a picture of Pete, 29, and reacted by saying that “he probably needs to see a dominatrix. I could see him really liking deprecation.” <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10><i>If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, contact the </i><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline</i></a><i> at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5xe5FuZqOtnJ6ubrLOsWSrnaaarq2%2FjKGmsGWjnbJussSeo6xlkZe8tsCMpKCmZZuWv6Wt0qGgmqZdnrtuusSwZKKmpJq%2Ft7XEsGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
