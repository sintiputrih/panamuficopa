The event was a part of Harvard’s “Sex Week,” a campaign to educate students about sex through a series of lectures and workshops at the university.</p><p>The week began with the workshop “Protection Methods: Condoms, IUDs, the Pill, Oh My!” on Monday, and will continue until Nov. 12th.</p><p>The anal sex workshop on Tuesday had a high turnout, with nearly 50 students attending the event. It was hosted by Natasha, a representative from the Cambridge-based adult shop Good Vibrations.</p><p>She said that the purpose of this event was to “encourage people to go after their desires and not feel shame.”</p><p>“Come up front guys, were gonna have some dirty fun,” Natasha said to students filed into the lecture hall.</p><p>One student was wearing a hot dog costume to the workshop.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-139559 alt="Harvard Anal" width=225 height=400 data-sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/harvard-anal.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-139559 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>The College Fix</span><span class=caption-body>Photo of a slide from the anal sex workshop.</span></p><p>She explained, “Not all men have penises, not all women have vaginas. The butthole is the great sexual equalizer. All humans have a butthole.”</p><p>The sex shop representative then showed some slides espousing the perks of anal sex. Among those listed were: “because it feels good,” “tantalizing taboo,” and “increases truth/intimacy.”</p><p>At one point in the presentation, she passed out gloves and butt plugs to students and offered instructions on anal relaxation techniques.</p><p>“Remember it’s all about practice, practice, practice,” Natasha told the class.</p><p>The crowd appeared enthusiastic and asked many detailed questions of the lecturer.</p><p>Throughout the lecture, Natasha went through a number of tips and techniques related to anal sex and expressed her incredulity for the taboo and restrictions placed on the sexual act.</p><p>“There are two types of people in this world, people who watch anal porn and dirty fucking liars,” Natasha told students.</p><p>She went on to say, “You couldn’t be fucked in the ass in Texas until about 10 minutes ago.”</p><p>This is in reference to <a href=# rel=noopener>sodomy laws</a> prohibiting anal sex that remained on the books in many US states, including Texas, until 2003.</p><p>Showing off one butt-plug sold at her shop, Natasha exclaimed, “a local guy named Greg makes these—salt of the Earth!”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-139560 alt="Sex Week Last Year" width=593 height=745 data-sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sex-week-last-year.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-139560 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Sex Week at Harvard/Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Image from a “Sex Week” lecture in 2016.</span></p><p>The event closed with a raffle for expensive sex toys, including butt plugs and vibrators, as well as free giveaways of male and female condoms, sex toy cleaners, and literature from Planned Parenthood.</p><p>Harvard’s Sex Week has run since 2011, and first hosted an anal sex workshop in 2014.
