The luminous celestial body spends approximately four weeks a month in each sign, and whichever it occupied when you were born is designated as your sign.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While we tend to refer to ourselves as our sun sign, it’s just one detail of a natal chart, which is basically a unique snapshot of the sky when you were born. Your chart serves as your astrological DNA throughout your life, offering insight on your mental and emotional wiring, as well as how you’ll respond to planetary shifts over time. So, if you’re a Scorpio who feels like a blurb describing you as “obsessive, magnetic, and secretive” couldn’t be further from the truth or a Capricorn who isn’t exactly a pragmatic workaholic, chances are other aspects of your chart — say, an outgoing Leo rising or airy Gemini moon — are overshadowing your sun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But while your sun sign is just one piece of a complex, multi-layered puzzle, it’s worth exploring, as it helps to color your core sense of self, identity, personal style, self-esteem, and confidence.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, what you need to know about the quadruplicities, or qualities, the four elements (fire, earth, air, and water), as well as details on each sun sign. Combined, they’ll serve to offer invaluable insight into what makes you tick.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Quadruplicities</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Every sign is assigned a quality (cardinal, mutable, or fixed), which explains the sign’s basic energy. There’s one sign per quality under each element. For example, within the water sign group, Cancer is the cardinal, Scorpio is fixed, and Pisces is mutable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cardinal: </strong>Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born at the start of any season, on a solstice or equinox, cardinal signs are visionaries who are driven to constantly generate new strategies for success. They’re often brimming with bold, brilliant ideas, but follow-through can feel like a slightly uphill battle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Mutable: </strong>Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born at the end of a given season, mutable signs are flexible, open to going with the flow, and typically willing to hear all sides of an issue before making a decision. In fact, it’s for this very reason that they can struggle to reach a conclusion, but once they do, you can rest assured they’ve left no stone unturned while gathering pertinent information.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fixed: </strong>Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fixed signs are stubborn but also rock-steady and achievement-oriented. They naturally get locked into a set pattern of behavior or perspective, which means it can be challenging for them to redirect.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fire></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Fire</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Demonstrative, outgoing, dynamic, and ambitious, fire signs can get animated quickly but run the risk of burning out fast. They thrive when they find a way to channel their passion in a sustainable, practical way.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Aries (March 21 – April 19)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The cardinal fire sign’s dynamism, impulsivity, and appetite for victory make them exciting, fun, courageous, and fearless. They’re your rockstar lawyer, teammate, the politician you would drop everything to canvas for, and the best friend who will go to bat for you time and again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Aries will likely fare best with a similarly free-spirited Sagittarius, up-for-anything Gemini, or attention-loving Leo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Aries celebs:</strong> America Ferrera, Reese Witherspoon, Lady Gaga, Emma Watson, Gloria Steinem, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Mariah Carey</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">More on Aries here</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Leo (July 23 - August 22)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fixed fire sign is full of life and positivity, commanding the spotlight in a way that’s sure to entertain, engage, and inspire others. Independent-minded and mesmerizingly fun to be around, you can rely on Leos in your circle to help you see the bright side of any situation and feel fired up and ready to take on the world.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Leo often sparks with a fellow joie de vivre-filled Sagittarius, active Aries, or romantic Libra.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Leo celebs:</strong> Meghan Markle, Gina Rodriguez, Jennifer Lopez, Monica Lewinsky, Jennifer Lawrence, Demi Lovato, and Cara Delevingne</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>More on Leo here</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Philosophical, curious, fun-loving, and determined to take life, love, and the world by storm, soaking up knowledge at every turn, the mutable fire sign tend to embrace a YOLO-esque perspective. They are the multi-hyphenate entertainers of the zodiac, coming off as gregarious, lively, dynamic, and they adore soaking up all the knowledge they can, especially around other cultures, distant travel destinations, politics, and social justice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Sag often hits it off with a similarly buoyant Leo, go-getter Aries, or free-spirited Aquarius.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sagittarius celebs:</strong> Chrissy Teigen, Janelle Monáe, Scarlett Johansson, Zoë Kravitz, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Tiffany Haddish, Anna Faris, and Christina Applegate</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>More on Sagittarius here</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-earth></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Earth</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Known to be grounded, stable, hard-working, service-oriented, and highly organized, earth signs are the perfectionists of the zodiac. Although their eye for detail and planning can be so helpful, they benefit from a self-care practice or support network that aids them in seeing the big picture.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fixed earth sign’s resolute character, pragmatism, patience, and love of luxury make them loyal, heartfelt, loving, and soothing to be around. They’re your favorite chef, Netflix and chill companion, date to a concert, or friend you can rely on to plan the most memorable spa day (even if it just entails throwing on a luxe face mask and sipping rosé at home).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Taurus often hits it off with a similarly service-oriented Virgo, home-loving, money-conscious Cancer, or industrious Capricorn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Taurus celebs</strong>: Lizzo, Adele, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Aidy Bryant, Tina Fey, Penelope Cruz, Ellie Kemper, and Gigi Hadid</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>More on Taurus here</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Virgo (August 23 - September 22)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Grounded empaths and lovers of language, knowledge, and being of service to those they love, the mutable earth sign is brimming with helpful information and action steps. They’re also being one of the first people to offer a shoulder to lean or cry on. They are the brainy A-students of the zodiac, quick to share what they know to steer the ship in the right direction — and if they don’t, they’ll go on a merciless hunt for those “just-right” details.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Virgo often hits it off with a similarly thoughtful Taurus, heartfelt and sensitive Cancer, or industrious and tradition-minded Capricorn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Virgo celebs:</strong> Zendaya, Beyonce, Blake Lively, Melissa McCarthy, Michelle Williams, Taraji P.

And then they set the bar even higher for themselves, leaving you impressed — and perhaps a bit envious of their no-fail go-getter energy. Their need to put in relentless work in order to get to the top of the professional mountain extends to their personal lives as well, as they tend to be ambitious in looking after their health, families, and long-term friendships.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Cap often hits it off with a similarly pragmatic <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taurus</a>, cerebral <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Virgo</a>, or driven <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Scorpio</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Capricorn celebs:</strong> Michelle Obama, Kate Middleton, Regina King, Zooey Deschanel, and January Jones</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>More on Capricorn here</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-air></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Air</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Focused on intellectual and social pursuits, sometimes idiosyncratic and changeable air signs are the connectors of the zodiac. Driven to gather and share information, they fare best when they have a specific endgame to pour their mental energy into.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_91-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_92-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Curious, enthusiastic, clever, and friendly, you can count on the mutable air sign to bring excitement, animated conversation, and fun-loving, lively energy to the table. Data, research, and the top trending news stories are like a go-to sugar fix for Geminis, and they have an appetite for discussing it all with anyone and everyone up for engaging.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_94-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Gemini often hits it off with a similarly social, flirtatious Libra, people-loving Aquarius, or dynamic Leo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_96-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Gemini celebs:</strong> Angelina Jolie, Octavia Spencer, Aly Raisman, Amy Schumer, Heidi Klum, Natalie Portman, the Olsen twins, Venus Williams, and Zoe Saldana.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_98-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>More on Gemini here</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_100-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Libra (September 22 - October 23)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_101-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harmony-seeking social butterflies whose hearts are drawn to art, music, dance, and connecting with others, the cardinal air sign is on a perpetual mission to make life lighthearted, fun, and more fair. They are the designers of the zodiac, eager to take any messy space and infuse it with beauty, and in cases where the scales of justice are off-kilter, they’ll pursue equity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_103-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Libra often connects best with flirty Gemini, people-loving, intellectual Aquarius, or fun-loving Leo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_105-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Libra celebs:</strong> Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Serena Williams, Brie Larson, Cardi B, Kim Kardashian, Hilary Duff, Bella Hadid, and Halsey</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_107-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>More on Libra here</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_109-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Aquarius (January 20 - February 18)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_110-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Free-spirited, friendly, personable, independent-minded, and humanitarian, the fixed air sign is committed to questioning and perhaps outright rejecting the status quo. Their appetite for community is also inspiring, as is their tendency to question, think, mull, explore, and experiment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_112-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Compatibility: </strong>They’re most compatible with similarly social, mentally-charged Geminis, host with the most Libras, or free-spirited Sagittarians.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_114-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Aquarius celebs:</strong> Kerry Washington, Shakira, Chloe Grace Moretz, Alicia Keys, Jennifer Aniston, and Elizabeth Banks</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_116-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>More on Aquarius here</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-water></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_118-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Water</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_119-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Family-oriented dreamers and artists, water signs are the deeply-feeling, at least slightly psychic empaths of the zodiac. They tend to let their big hearts run the show and can stay afloat in that sea of emotion when they connect with their spirituality and pour it into their favorite creative outlets.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_121-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_122-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The cardinal water sign is known for being nurturing, sensitive, compassionate, self-protective, security-seeking and offering, loving, and displaying a goofy, ingratiating sense of humor. They tend to prioritize — and occasionally twist themselves into knots — to make most people in their life feel even slightly more comfortable and secure, so you can rely on the Cancers in your life to offer a shoulder to cry on and freshly baked cookies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_124-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Cancer often sparks with a fellow sensual Scorpio, empathetic Pisces, or similarly sensitive caregiver Virgo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_126-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cancer celebs: </strong>Mindy Kaling, Kristen Bell, Priyanka Chopra, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, Solange, Tess Holliday, Lana Del Rey, Malala Yousafzai, Elizabeth Warren, and Margot Robbie</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_128-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>More on Cancer here</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_130-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scorpio (October 23 - November 21)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_131-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fixed water sign is extremely private, even secretive, about subjects they consider near and dear to their hearts and being intensely sexual (whether or not they’re willing to open up about that side of them). They are fiercely magnetic, often managing to effortlessly command the spotlight. Spiritual, wise, and enchanting, you can guarantee that the Scorpios in your life will inspire and empower you to pinpoint and live your truth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_133-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Scorpio often hits it off with family-oriented Cancer, empathetic Pisces, or similarly driven Capricorn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_135-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Scorpio celebs:</strong> Amandla Stenberg, Katy Perry, Ciara, Gabrielle Union, Emma Stone, Anne Hathaway, and Shailene Woodley</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_137-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>More on Scorpio here</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_139-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Pisces (February 19 - March 20)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_140-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Compassionate, romantic, artistic, intensely empathic, and sensitive, the mutable water sign is the obvious creative of the zodiac. When they channel their emotions into their favorite art form, they feel more centered and enlightened. Empathic and probably the most in tune with the metaphysical of any sign, Pisces are some of the most magical people you’ll ever come in contact with.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_142-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Pisces often sparks with a sentimental Cancer, deeply-feeling Scorp, or similarly mellow Taurus.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_144-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pisces celebs: </strong>Rihanna, Drew Barrymore, Eva Mendes, Rashida Jones, Olivia Wilde, Emily Blunt, Lupita Nyong'o, and Rebel Wilson</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_146-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>More on Pisces here</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme5BrZLOnlJ6upHnSop6nqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
