Scientists dubbed the species Myloplus sauron after the Eye of Sauron, the villain from the Lord of the Rings series, because of the black line on the fish’s body that looks like Sauron’s fiery pupil.</p><p>M. sauron is a type of pacu, which are closely related to piranhas. However, unlike their cousins, pacu have flat, human-like teeth that they use to eat the plants that primarily make up their diet.</p><p>This discovery has reminded researchers just how much is still unknown about the Amazon’s wildlife.</p><h2>Scientists Accidentally Discover Myloplus Sauron</h2><p>In 1841, researchers discovered Myloplus schomburgkii, a species of fish related to piranhas. Nearly 200 years later, scientists conducting genetic analyses on a population of M. schomburgkii in the Amazon River discovered that the fish they were looking at actually weren’t all from the same species. In fact, they belonged to three nearly identical species: Myloplus schomburgkii, Myloplus sauron, and Myloplus aylan.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-496498 alt="Eye Of Sauron" width=900 height=450 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/eye-of-sauron.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-496498 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>New Line Cinema</span><span class=caption-body>The Eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings series.</span></p><p>The researchers noticed small differences between the three types of fish. They had varying numbers of vertebrae and dorsal fin rays, and the female specimens’ anal fins were shaped differently.</p><p>A new study published in <a href=# rel=noopener>Neotropical Ichthyology</a> describes these distinctions.</p><p>So, how did the researchers decide on the name of M. sauron?</p><h2>The Fish Named After The Lord Of The Rings Villain</h2><p>One of the study’s co-authors, Rupert Collins, is the senior curator of fishes at the Natural History Museum in London. In a <a href=# rel=noopener>statement</a> from the museum, Collins noted of M. sauron, “Its pattern looks a lot like the Eye of Sauron, especially with the orange patches on its body. As soon as one of my colleagues came up with the name for this fish, we knew it was perfect for it.”</p><p>M. sauron is part of the Serrasalmidae family alongside piranhas. Although these fish have a reputation for being vicious killers, M. sauron feast mainly on plants. Like other pacu, they have human-like teeth that allow them to grind up vegetation.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-496510 alt="Pacu Teeth" width=700 height=525 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pacu-teeth.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-496510 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation</span><span class=caption-body>An example of a pacu with human-like teeth.</span></p><p>M. sauron are only found in the Xingu River Basin, a Brazilian tributary of the Amazon containing more than 600 species of fish.</p><p>Now, researchers are trying to determine how closely related M. sauron is to M. schomburgkii and M. aylan. It is possible that they share a common ancestor, but researchers also believe that they may have simply evolved to look the same.</p><p>“There wasn’t enough evidence to suggest whether these three species all descend from one common ancestor, or whether they evolved convergently,” Collins said. “For now, we’ve left them in the Myloplus genus, but they might be moved in the future.”</p><p>Scientists estimate that there may still be thousands of fish species yet to be identified in the Amazon River, but the discovery of M. sauron brings us one step closer to uncovering the mysteries of its depths.</p><p>After reading about the discovery of Myloplus sauron, dive into the story of the <a href=#>Megatherium</a>, the massive prehistoric sloth that once roamed the Amazon. Then, learn about the <a href=#>candiru</a>, the Amazonian fish that allegedly targets penises.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyuxcuop6Wto2LAosHRqKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
