The 25-year-old was smiling and laughing as she gamed at the Super Smash Bros for Wii U Celebrity Fight Club bash. She palled around with Pretty Little Liars' Keegan Allen and Step Up 3D's Rick Malambri, among others, making it to the final rounds of the competition.</p><p>It was fitting to see her at a Nintendo event because she and her father had a <a href=#>strong gaming bond</a>. Not only was she named after Princess Zelda from The Legend of Zelda (Robin said the name was "magical – like she is"), but she and her dad appeared together in ad spots for the company.</p><p>It was her second public appearance since Williams's Aug. 11 suicide. She and her brothers, Zak and Cody, were on hand with Billy Crystal to <a href=#>throw out the first pitch</a>, in honor of Robin, at Game 5 of the World Series in San Francisco. (Robin called the Bay Area home.)</p><p>Zelda's appearance on Tuesday comes at a time when her father is back in the news. On Friday, his <a href=#>autopsy results</a> were released, determining that he died from asphyxia due to hanging, and there were no illegal drugs in his system when he passed away. In the days leading to his death, Robin – who suffered from depression and had been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in the fall of 2013 – had a "recent increase in paranoia."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He also appeared to suffer from an Alzheimer's-like condition called Lewy body dementia. <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported the disease may have contributed to Williams's decision to end his own life.</p><p>But Zelda is pressing on with her own. After briefly <a href=#>quitting social media</a> following Robin's death and paying tribute to him with a <a href=#>new tattoo</a>, it's nice to see her easing back into her normal life. And just having some fun.</p><p><a href=#>Follow Suzy Byrne on Twitter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaznZyZrm7DyKWjopmdqHqiuMtmqqahnJrAbq3TZp2iqqOpeqm7y6WwsKefmXqmwsSnq2armaOwpnnRqJmipqNisaat06Fka2hhaX50fZBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
