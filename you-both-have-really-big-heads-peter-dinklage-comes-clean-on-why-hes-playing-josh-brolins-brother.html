As <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Dinklage</a></strong> tells it, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Brolin</a></strong> was in as soon as he heard why it would be such a great idea, and it’s about as funny as it gets.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Peter Dinklage has been playing such huge roles as Miles Finch in Elf, Eddie in Pixels, and Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones. In fact, he set a record for winning four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor for his role as Tyrion. It’s not hard to imagine that at this point in his career, he gets phone calls all the time from some of the top people in Hollywood.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>Josh Brolin was on the other end of that phone call when Dinklage was pitched to star in Brother. Brolin is known for such roles as Cable in Deadpool 2 and Thanos in the Avengers franchise, as well as the principal of Brolin Productions. With success in such huge parts himself, if Peter Dinklage was going to get a phone call from someone who could make things happen, it would be Josh.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Collider</a> Editor-in-Chief Steve Weintraub, Dinklage spilled on how that phone call went, and it’s not what anyone would imagine. It’s hilarious how it went down, though, because it appears that a friend of Josh simply observed one day, “You and Dinklage both have really big heads, you guys should play brothers.”</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>What a reason to make a movie, right? So, Josh gave Dinklage a call and asked, as Dinklage recalls, “My friend said this, you wanna play?”</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>Dinklage went on to explain how he’s such a fan of Josh’s work. Of course, he couldn’t pass up a chance to work with him. So, he answered, “Yeah, movies have been made for less ideas than that, this is perfect.”</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=false>After that phone conversation, Brolin and Dinklage started the work of pitching the movie premise to studios and now it’s coming true. When Brother breaks box office records and gets a high audience ranking on Rotten Tomatoes, they should look at getting a hold of Ron Perlman to play a long-lost third brother in the sequel. Wouldn’t he fit the team perfectly? It’s not too late to add him now, despite the ten other projects he’s likely currently working on at the moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TGsMGMm6atoF2drrexjKucmqScrnqjtcZmn56ZlKh6sbHTnqlmnJmjuK2txp5knKedmsBur8uemKdln6N6uLTYZp%2Beq12luaLFyKeeZqKfqLVurtGoo6Kmo2Kvs7vToZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
