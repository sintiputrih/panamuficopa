Tonight, two dancers will be eliminated. Although it’s anyone’s game, the <a href=#>early front-runner to win is&nbsp;Cole Mills</a>.</p><p id=par-3_32>Now that we’re in the live show phase, fans will definitely want to tune in as the episode airs, so what are the easiest ways to watch&nbsp;So You Think You Can Dance&nbsp;online?</p><p id=par-4_65>Well, the easiest way would be via the <a href=#>live TV page on Fox’s website</a> or on the Fox Now app, which you can download on services like Roku and Apple TV. You’ll need a cable log-in order to make use of these options, though, so this will only work if either you subscribe to cable or you can borrow the log-in of someone who does.</p><p id=par-5_55>If that doesn’t work out, the next best option would be to sign up for a free trial of any number of live-TV streaming services, including Sling TV. With Sling, you can stream a wide range of TV channels on your computer or on an app, and Fox is included in the Sling Blue package.</p><p id=par-6_75><a href=#>Sling offers a seven-day free trial</a>, so if you want to watch tonight’s episode live, you can sign up for that and then just cancel the trial in a week. Do note, though, that you’ll need to put a credit or debit card on file, and you’ll have to make sure you remember to cancel in seven days in order to avoid being charged $25 (unless you do actually decide to stick with the service).</p><p id=par-7_79>It’s also crucial that when you’re signing up, you choose the Sling Blue plan, as the Sling Orange plan doesn’t include Fox. You can also choose the Sling Orange + Blue plan, which grants you access to all of the channels from both packages. That costs $40 a month, but if you don’t actually plan on ever paying for a full month and are going to cancel in a week anyway, you might as well go for this one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GettyImages-89653802.jpg><p id=par-8_42>Once you’ve signed up for your free trial, you’ll be able to watch&nbsp;So You Think You Can Dance&nbsp;on Fox either via the Sling website or by downloading the Sling app on a number of devices, including Roku, Fire TV, and Apple TV.</p><p id=par-9_85>If don’t want to sign up for Sling, or if you’ve already taken advantage of their trial once before, you can alternatively sign up for a trial for YouTube TV, a similar service that Google offers. This one is $40 a month, and it includes Fox in its package. You can <a href=#>sign up for a seven-day free trial</a>&nbsp;and then use it to watch&nbsp;So You Think You Can Dance, but just remember to cancel after a week if you don’t want to keep your subscription going.</p><p id=par-10_39>Finally, a third option would be <a href=#>Hulu Live TV,</a>&nbsp;which once again includes Fox. Hulu offers a one-week trial of this service, which costs $40 a month, although that includes the entire Hulu library that normally costs $7.99 a month.</p><p id=par-11_13>So You Think You Can Dance&nbsp;airs at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Fox.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMraZmq6SnsqK5jKymZrGfqnq1tMinomaxn6p6pK3NZpuappOaeq211Z5kqKacnrumesetpKVn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
