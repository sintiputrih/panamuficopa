She won three of the four events in the competition, with a comfortable winning margin of 4.7 points.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We came out here, and we did what we were supposed to," Biles <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/news/simone-biles-wins-record-seventh-u-s-all-around-title data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">said</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Biles has dominated the world of gymnastics for eight years, winning every all-around competition she's entered since 2013. Her easy win this past weekend was in large part thanks to her four dazzling routines, one of which included a historical move known as the Yurchenko double pike that prior female gymnasts have had yet to attempt in competition.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Debuted by Biles at the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usagymclassic.com/2021/05/biles-debuts-unprecedented-yurchenko-double-pike-vault-en-route-to-fifth-gk-u-s-classic-title/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="GK U.S. Classic" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">GK U.S. Classic</a> preceding nationals last month, the move involves two straight-legged backflips in the air launched by a roundoff back handspring, requiring perilous amounts of momentum, speed, and strength. Well-aware of the ambitious vault move she had then just pulled off, she took to Twitter to share her excitement over completing the unprecedented feat. As she should.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The champion gymnast has previously performed other moves that went down in history, with four elements officially taking after her name in the Women's Artistic Gymnastics Code of Points: one for vault, one for balance beam, and two for floor exercises. Following this competition, the Yurchenko double pike <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/sports/olympics/simone-biles-yurchenko-double-pike.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="saw speculation" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">saw speculation</a> over its own place on this Biles-dedicated list, in addition to its difficulty score of 6.6, which some deemed too low given the move's arguable difficulty level relative to other so-called standard competing stunts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her win from the weekend officially qualifies her for July's Tokyo Olympics, where she is set to compete as part of the USA Women's Gymnastics Team. "It's really emotional, especially going into my second time doing an Olympic run. It's really crazy," Biles <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sZN4OfgSyE" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">said</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I feel like I did try to enjoy it, because it could be one of my last championships that I'll attend," she also <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/news/simone-biles-wins-record-seventh-u-s-all-around-title data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=shared class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">shared</a>. "But it's also the road to Tokyo, and after this we have trials, so we just have to really embrace the moment."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ef84b592-a2b0-47e0-8e6c-e29e8d3ddc25_1619719162.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Sabrina Park" title="Headshot of Sabrina Park" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sabrina Park is a Digital Fellow at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HarpersBAZAAR.com</a> where she covers news, fashion, and culture stories.
