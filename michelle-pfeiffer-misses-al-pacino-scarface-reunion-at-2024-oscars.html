However, the actors didn’t get off on the right foot.</p><p>“He didn’t particularly want me for the part,” Pfeiffer admitted during a 2017 appearance on <a href=# rel=noopener>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>, referring to Pacino. “My last credit before that was <a href=#>Grease 2</a>. Can you blame him?”</p><p>During the “very long and drawn-out auditioning process,” Pfeiffer was able so show off her acting chops.</p><p>“I was terrified, and I was really young, and I knew he didn’t want me, and as it went on, the worse I got because I just got so afraid,” Pfeiffer recalled, noting that the movie’s legendary director, <strong>Brian de Palma</strong>, was “rooting” for her to get the part. But her nerves got the best of her and eventually, things didn’t work out … at first.</p><p>A month later, Pfeiffer got a call for a screen test. Because she felt like she had “no shot” at booking the part­, the actress was not “afraid” anymore.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We do the restaurant scene at the end where I, kind of, freak out at the end.
