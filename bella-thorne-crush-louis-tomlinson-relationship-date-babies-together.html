When it comes down to it, “<span class=il>Bella</span>&nbsp;<span class=il>would</span> absolutely date <span class=il>Louis,” our insider dished.</span>&nbsp;“She loves hot, talented guys like <span class=il>Louis,</span>” so of course he’s her type.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Not to mention, “<span class=il>Bella</span> has always been a fan of One Direction and <span class=il>would</span> say ‘yes’ to <span class=il>Louis</span> if he asked her out.” OMG. As for what she likes about the sexy singer? — His incredible hair, adorable&nbsp;accent, and in true Bella from, she thinks&nbsp;“<span class=il>they</span> <span class=il>would</span> <span class=il>have</span> <span class=il>gorgeous</span> <span class=il>babies&nbsp;</span><span class=il>together</span>.” Come on guys, the actress has never been one to sensor her words… or her fit body [as seen below].</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>[jwplatform rL7JKPoH]</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Now, let us remind you that Bella only commented on Louis’ photo with one simple word — “awww.” She left the harmless comment on a photo he posted to his Instagram with his up-and-coming girl group. Well, fans thought Bella was making a pass at the singer, you know, since she’s never shy about her feelings when it comes to dating or hooking up, and they ripped her apart on social media.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>But, we also learned that she’s just brushing it all off like a good sport. While Bella thought it was “hilarious” how fans reacted, her intentions were pure. “She meant it as a sweet, innocent remark and was surprised at the reaction,” our insider said.</p><h3>Pics: Kylie Jenner Vs. Bella Thorne: Who Is Hotter?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Honestly, Bella’s comment was a complete surprise to a lot of people because it was kind of out of left field. While Bella and Louis may be friends, a lot of fans claimed they’ve never even seen them communicate. However, these two stars are apparently single. Although Bella has a track record of bouncing from <strong>Gregg Sulkin</strong>, 24, to <strong>Tyler Posey</strong>, 25, to <strong>Charlie Puth</strong>, 25, within just a few months of each other, she’s a single gal right now. And, everyone knows she goes after what she wants.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Louis, on the other hand, was in a serious relationship with actress&nbsp;<strong>Danielle Campbell</strong>, 22, but, reports claim that these two have split. The reason? — Well, they haven’t been seen together since before his mother,&nbsp;<strong>Johannah Deakin</strong>’s sad death on Dec. 7, 2016. Louis received an incredible amount of support from his 1D brothers following the tragic death of his mother and he’s been busy working ever since. But, we’ve seen no sign of Danielle… so, do you think Bella will make a move?</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, would you want to see Bella and Louis date?
