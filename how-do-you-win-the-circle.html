In this show, players move into an apartment complex together — however, there is no neighborly interaction. In fact, contestants don’t see each other at all until the conclusion of the show.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>How the show works is that players interact with one another through a social media application created for the show. On here, contestants can choose how they portray themselves to their opponents with the goal of being the most liked of the bunch.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>At the end of each episode, each contestant rates each other, and the players with the two highest ratings become influencers, with the other contestants risking being “blocked” and eliminated from the game. Once blocked, players may have the opportunity to meet other players still in the game in person, and the day following their elimination, the remaining players are shown the real identity of the blocked contestant.</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>With its unique premise, you may be wondering just how you can win The Circle and take home that $100,000 prize. Here’s what viewers should know.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>How To Win The Circle</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>Similar to how it has functioned through the elimination portion of the series, the winner of The Circle is determined through the rating system as the highest-rated player still in the game.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>It’s that simple! The winner will then take home the $100,000 prize but for those who hadn’t made it to the end, there is still hope as there is a second $10,000 prize handed out after fans cast their votes of who their favorite member from the series was.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>So that’s it. To win The Circle you’ll need to build the trust of your fellow contestants so they prefer you above the rest of the bunch when it comes time to make those important rating decisions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9Zmm6hlqaTCbsPIp2StoJVisKq%2BwqWcaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
