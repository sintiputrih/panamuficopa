This is a soft sandwich bread but can still hold up to any type of spread you put on it.&nbsp;</p><p>Think of this as Wonder Bread — a fluffy, white loaf of bread made with simple ingredients. The addition of butter and milk gives it a touch of richness and creates such a soft texture.</p><p>In France, this may be referred to as Pain de Mie, which means bread of crumb.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-Best-White-Sandwich-Bread-Loaf-Recipe-Slice-of-Homemade-Bread-720x792.jpg alt="Simple soft white sandwich bread is perfect for homemade toast with butter and jam or sandwiches.

Last week, I experimented and let my bread dough rise outside, completely covered, to keep in the moisture. The bread dough rose in record time — 35-45 minutes! This is one of the perks of Arizona summers!</p><p>I love to use this white sandwich bread to make almond butter and homemade berry jam sandwiches, turkey and cheese, or simple butter and honey.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-Best-White-Sandwich-Bread-Loaf-Recipe-720x810.jpg alt="Simple soft white sandwich bread is perfect for homemade toast with butter and jam or sandwiches.

I suggest mixing the yeast, warm water or milk (about 105-110 degrees), and a touch of sugar into a bowl. The sugar will help to “feed” the yeast and help it to activate quicker. Yeast loves sugar! The warm water or milk also helps to activate the yeast. If the water or milk is too hot, it can kill the yeast, but if it is too cool, it won’t incorporate with the other ingredients.</p><p>The yeast should start to become foamy or bubbles will begin to surface. This is a great sign that the yeast is working. Let it work for at least 5 minutes to see if it begins to proof.&nbsp;</p><p>If nothing happens, start again with a new batch of yeast, warm water, and sugar.</p><p>One other tip when trying to get the yeast to begin to foam and bubble, make sure to keep it away from salt as the salt can kill the yeast.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/White-Sandwich-Bread-Dough-Rising-scaled.jpg alt="White Sandwich Bread Dough Rising" width=2171 height=2560 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><figure class=wp-block-image></figure><h2>How will I know when my bread dough has risen enough?</h2><p>As a general rule of thumb, most bread will have risen enough when the bread dough doubles in size. You can check to see if it has risen enough, by poking the top of the dough with your finger. Fully risen and fermented dough will retain the finger indentation as it doesn’t bounce back because the gluten has been adequately stretched.</p><p>If you love to bake bread, check out these other popular bread recipes that are so easy to make!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/White-Sandwich-Bread-Dough-scaled.jpg alt="White Sandwich Bread Dough Rising" width=2560 height=1838 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>My Favorite Bread Baking Tools:</h3><p>The photo below shows the white bread after it has had its second rise time.
