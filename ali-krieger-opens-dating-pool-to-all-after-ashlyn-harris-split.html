Krieger, 39, joked that she “might be opening up to 100 percent of the population, instead of 50 [percent], at this time.”</p><p>“Kickin’ It” cohost <strong>Maurice Edu</strong> then quipped, “I got some friends that might be submitting some applications.” Krieger’s former U.S. Women’s National Team teammate <strong>Heather O’Reilly</strong> then responded to the clip via Instagram, commenting, “I’m dying. 100 percent of the pop be popping off from this.”</p><p>Krieger and Harris, who played together for the Orlando Pride and NJ/NY Gotham FC, began dating in 2010 and married in 2019. They filed for divorce in October 2023. The pair have two kids together, Sloane and Ocean.</p><p>Harris, 38, has since been linked to actress <strong>Sophia Bush</strong>.</p><p>While Krieger and Harris are no longer together, they remain committed to their kids. Harris recently posted a photo of Krieger and Sloane via Instagram, celebrating Sloane’s third birthday.</p><p>Harris captioned <a href=#>the photo</a>: “Happy Birthday Sweetheart. We love you. I can’t believe my baby is 3 today. May you shine all your light into this world. You truly are a gift to us all. I am so proud to be your Momma.”</p><p>In the time since the couple officially split, Krieger has put herself first, telling <a href=# rel=noopener>Self magazine</a> in November 2023 that while she had met “the most broken version” of herself earlier that year, she had emerged stronger.</p><p>“I feel like I can get through anything, and I am so ready for this next phase,” she said. “I feel like the universe has sent me a gift, and I’m ready to take it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Krieger insisted to CBS that while she is ready to date again, romance will not be her primary focus this year.</p><p>“I think 2024 is going to be just me continuing to put myself first and work on myself,” she said, “so that I am a complete Ali — so that I don’t carry all of this past trauma into that next relationship.”</p><p>Krieger retired from soccer as a champion, winning the NWSL title with Gotham FC last year. She’s been an outspoken advocate for women in sports and LGBTQIA+ rights, and all indications are she will carry those passions into her post-playing career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapJliuLO1xKCcq2WfpbKvv4ydmK2hnpx6sbvOpWStp12Wua15wJ%2BrnqpdlsCpuNinZKGZoqe2tHnSqaOirF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
