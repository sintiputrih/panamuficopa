The actress cited the reason as “irreconcilable differences” and listed their date of separation as August 13. Gilbert requested joint and legal custody of their son Rhodes, 4. The former The Talk cohost is also the mother of son Levi, 15, and daughter Sawyer, 12, who she shares with ex <strong>Ali Adler.</strong></p><p>Gilbert and Perry began dating in 2011 before the former 4 Non Blondes lead singer proposed in a romantic musical picnic in April 2013. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The pair exchanged vows </a>nearly one year later in March 2014.</p><p>The Roseanne alum announced in April that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was leaving as cohost of The Talk</a>, where she has sat on the panel since 2010, to expand her work opportunities and to spend more time with her family.</p><p>Perry revealed to Us in November that she and Gilbert<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> didn’t have plans for more children.</a></p><p>“Sara can’t have any more kids,” the musician said at the time. “That part’s done.

I’m always trying to teach kids. My artist friends are always bringing their 13-year-olds to my studio, like, ‘OK! Do your thing!’ So it’s fun. There are always kids. There’s always somebody that needs you.”</p><p>As for the holidays, Perry said that she and Gilbert had differing opinions on how to celebrate. While the songwriter enjoyed being festive, Gilbert wasn’t as keen on traditions.</p><p>“Before me, Sara did nothing,” she shared. “There was no Valentine’s Day, there was no Halloween, there was no Christmas, there was jack s–t in that family before I showed up! I introduced the kids to Halloween, Christmas — it’s a Jewish family but I brought Christmas in. … I’m basically pushing my traditions.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaKWeqi1y5ucq6xdqL2wwNOem2avmam1sMHTZq6enJSeu6h50aKloGWRm8GmvoyloKeckWK9pr7RsmSsqJyewXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
