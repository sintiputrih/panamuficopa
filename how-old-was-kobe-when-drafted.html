He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, and his impact on the sport is undeniable. One of the most interesting things about Bryant is his early entry into the NBA. In this article, we will explore how old Kobe was when he was drafted into the NBA and how his career unfolded.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kobe Bryant was only 17 years old when he was drafted into the NBA in 1996. At the time, he was the youngest player ever to be drafted by an NBA team. This was a bold move for Bryant, as he was foregoing a college education to enter the league. Ultimately, he decided to go directly into the NBA, becoming only the sixth player in NBA history to do so.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Bryant's decision to enter the NBA directly out of high school was a risky move. There was a lot of pressure on him to perform, and many people doubted that he would be able to succeed at such a young age. However, Bryant was determined to prove his doubters wrong. He worked tirelessly to improve his game and quickly became one of the most exciting young players in the league.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite his youth, Bryant quickly proved that he belonged in the NBA. He was a reserve player in his first season, but he quickly became an All-Star. He continued to improve his game and worked tirelessly to become the best player in basketball. His goal was to surpass Michael Jordan's success, and he was well on his way to achieving that goal.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Bryant's career hit a bump in the road in 2003 when he was accused of sexual assault. This incident had a significant impact on his public image, and he lost many of his sponsors. Bryant was eventually cleared of the charges, but the damage had already been done. This was a difficult time for Bryant, but he persevered and continued to work on his game.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2005, Phil Jackson joined the Lakers as coach, and Bryant's game improved exponentially. He became a vital part of the team that won championships in 2009 and 2010. During this time, he emerged as the leader of the Lakers and helped lead the team to victory. These championships cemented Bryant's legacy as one of the greatest players of all time.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Today, Bryant is the last remaining player from the 1996 NBA rookie class. Other notable players from that class, such as Steve Nash, Ray Allen, Jermaine O'Neal, Derek Fisher, Allen Iverson, Peja Stojakovic, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, and Stephon Marbury, have either retired or not played in the NBA for several years. Bryant's future in the NBA is uncertain, but when he retires, the star power of the 1996 draft class will be gone.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kobe Bryant was only 17 years old when he was drafted into the NBA. This was a bold move for a young player, but Bryant was determined to prove his doubters wrong. He quickly became one of the most exciting young players in the league and worked tirelessly to improve his game. Despite some setbacks, he went on to become one of the greatest players of all time. Bryant's legacy in the NBA is secure, and he will always be remembered as one of the sport's greatest icons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hprBln6GxbsPArGSkp5Kaeri0xKdknaqRm8GmsA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
