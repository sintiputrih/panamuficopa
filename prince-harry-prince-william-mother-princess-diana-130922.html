Afghan was the moment where I was like, ‘Right, deal with it.'”</p><p>In the BBC documentary, Mind Over Marathon, his big bro, William, also opened up about their mom’s passing. “The shock is the biggest thing. I still have shock within me,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/prince-harry-prince-william-princess-diana.jpg><p>Diana with William and Harry.</p><p>In a previous interview, Kate Middleton’s husband <a href=#>got candid about mental health</a> as well. “Mental health was the great taboo.
