Sadly, these will never be met as he shockingly passed away on August 24th. Now it appears Bray Wyatt had many doubters of his insane ideas in WWE.</p><p><a href=#>Bray Wyatt passed away</a>&nbsp;at the age of 36, shocking fans and the pro wrestling world alike as they slowly come to terms with such a tragic loss. Wyatt will be remembered for being an incredible human being and more.</p><p>While speaking on the <a href=#>Something To Wrestle</a> podcast, Bruce Prichard talked about Bray Wyatt’s creative ideas that were seen as incomprehensible by many backstage in WWE. He credited Bray Wyatt for getting the ideas over as Wyatt believed in them and revealed that quite a few backstage doubted his ideas as well.</p><p>“I don’t know if there were maybe a handful of people — and when I say a handful, one handful — that thought this is just different enough, this is going to work big time. There were a lot more that were looking at us going, ‘What in the f*** is this?’ I’m back and new and I’m just begging, ‘Just go with it, try it.’</p><p>We were given a lot of leeway. That was the point: you weren’t supposed to get it. You were supposed to sit back, enjoy it, and go along for a ride. And it took you on a ride. Kudos to Bray for being able to pull off those crazy ideas and continue to pull that off in a way that kept people captivated for a long time.”</p><p><a href=#>Bray Wyatt’s cause of death was revealed</a>&nbsp;soon after the news of his passing broke. WWE’s tribute show for Bray Wyatt was an emotional roller coaster from start to finish, as the world is coming to grips with the fact that Bray Wyatt is no more. Regardless, Wyatt will live in our hearts forever and that’s never changing.</p><p>What do you think of what Bruce Prichard said? What was your favorite Bray Wyatt moment in WWE?
