Still, it was the diamond that took center stage.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a href=#><strong>Mike Fried</strong></a>, the CEO of The Diamond Pro, estimates that Giudice’s new rock is “about” 8 carats and has an estimated value of “at least” $300,000. “Her channel set band features smaller diamonds, adding exceptional character to the design,” Fried added.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While the engagement was definitely a very welcomed surprise for the 49-year-old Real Housewives of New Jersey star, it’s safe to say Giudice had been <a href=#>enjoying every second</a> of the getaway with her beau leading up to the point when he got down on one knee. “Don’t ever stop dreaming #love #soulmate #greece,” she captioned a Tuesday, October 19, Instagram photo of the couple enjoying their vacation.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Earlier that day, she gave her followers a sneak peek into how she was spending her time abroad. “Up up and away with you is where I will always be,” she captioned a photo of her and Ruelas sitting inside a private helicopter.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Digital Media Solutions founder shared the same image on his own Instagram page. He captioned his post: “I’ll fly anywhere in the world with you Teresa </span><span class=s2>✈️</span> <span class=s2>✈️</span> <span class=s1>you are my favorite person </span><span class=s2>❤️</span> <span class=s1>LOVE YOU </span><span class=s2>😍</span><span class=s1>.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While fans now know that the couple is engaged, a quick scroll through the comments section proves that many RHONJ devotees <a href=#>had their suspicions </a>ahead of time. “Put a ring on that already LOL Us Jersey girls are treasures,” a user wrote. Another added: “But did you get engaged?! We need to know.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The couple <a href=#><span class=s4>went Instagram official</span></a> in December 2020 after four months of keeping their relationship low-key. She captioned the adorable pic, “The BEST thing that came out of 2020 </span><span class=s5>❣️</span><span class=s1>.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The TV personality was previously married to Joe Giudice, but the pair called it quits in December 2019.
