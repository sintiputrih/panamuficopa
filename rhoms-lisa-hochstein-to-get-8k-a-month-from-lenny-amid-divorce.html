The filing specified that Lenny should pay for his kids’ medical insurance, school tuition, extracurricular activities and summer camp — in addition to $60,000 worth of Lisa’s legal fees. The judge’s decision will be in effect until the former couple reach a new agreement or the court issues a new order.</p><p>The Bravolebrities — who tied the knot in October 2009 — <a href=#>announced their split</a> in May 2022.</p><p>“Lisa and I are getting divorced. A few weeks ago, I denied this because I am trying my best to protect my family during this process,” Lenny said in a statement to Us Weekly&nbsp;at the time, shortly after he was <a href=#>spotted partying</a> with model <a href=#><strong>Katharina Mazepa</strong></a> in Miami.</p><p>He continued: “It is true that I am seeing Katharina, but none of this happened until after the decision was made to get divorced. This is a very difficult time and I would ask for some privacy so that we can best take care of our children who mean the world to us.”</p><p>Since publicly acknowledging their breakup, the reality TV stars have been less than civil in their divorce proceedings. In November 2022, Lisa claimed that her estranged husband had <a href=#>cut her off financially</a>.</p><p>“[Lenny’s] clear strategy now is to force [Lisa] into submission by refusing to provide [Lisa] or minor children with any direct support,” a legal filing obtained by Us alleged. “[Lenny] has the ability to throw lavish parties, but doesn’t have the ability or desire to provide support to [Lisa] and the parties’ two young children?”</p><p>The doctor hit back with his own claims in January, calling Lisa’s requests for support “excessive” and claiming that <a href=#>his estranged wife</a> “drives luxury vehicles including a Range Rover and a Rolls Royce.”</p><p>That same month, Lenny told Us that taking care of his children was his primary concern.</p><p>“I just want to make sure my kids are taken care of,” he said in January. “Whatever happens, I want to make sure they have a great life and are taken care of and want for nothing.”</p><p>The Russia native added that the contentious divorce <a href=#>hadn’t “soured” his views on romance</a>. “I’m not soured at all. Sometimes things don’t work out,” he told Us, adding that he is neutral about the idea of someday getting remarried.</p><p>“I’m neither open nor not open to it,” he explained. “I have an open mind with everything.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lisa, for her part, previously opened up about the end of her marriage playing out on <a href=#>season 5 of RHOM</a>, which aired from December 2022 to March.</p><p>“I’m <a href=#>dreading [watching the season]</a> ’cause I wasn’t expecting it,” she told Us at <a href=#>BravoCon</a> in October 2022. “Like, I couldn’t control my emotions. … I wanted to tap out so many times, you know? … [But] I signed up for the show. And it is what it is, and he did it to me [while I was filming] the show.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BiwG64yKyYZqCfmLW0wMSipWasn2K0psCMcaJmmV2ivK%2FAx2adq6edYrmmus2yZJqlmZl6pbXVqKmcnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
