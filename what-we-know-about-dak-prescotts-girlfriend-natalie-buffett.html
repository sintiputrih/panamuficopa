However, Prescott only has eyes for one lady â€” his girlfriend Natalie Buffett. <a href=#>People</a> reports that the couple went Instagram official in July 2020. "Happy birthday babe!" Buffett captioned <a href=#>a cute pic</a> of the two of them together. She's since posted multiple photos of her and the NFL star, including a photo of them on the NFL Honors red carpet in February 2022. "The best date," she <a href=#>captioned the shot</a>. And, things have gotten pretty heavy between the two, with them sharing a house and four dogs.</p><p dir=ltr>Buffett, an Instagram model, and influencer, isn't just a pretty face. According to her <a href=#>LinkedIn</a>, she graduated from Southern Methodist with a civil engineering degree and has been "director of content creation and strategy" for Oxe Fit, Dallas, Texas, since 2021.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>She's also been there for her baller boo through thick and thin, injuries and all. <a href=#>ESPN</a> reports that Prescott suffered a "gruesome" injury in October 2020, including a compact fracture and dislocation of his right ankle. Then, in September 2022, he was forced to sit out four games following a thumb injury, per <a href=#>The Athletic</a>.&nbsp;The most challenging time of all for the couple, though, was getting through the tragic death of the NFL star's brother, Jace Prescott.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmboZ1f46wn5qsXayybrfNqK5mmZKkwrV5w5qiZqiimsCku9Otqmafmae5p77InqWdZZ6WwaK4yJ5km62Wm7K1wI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
