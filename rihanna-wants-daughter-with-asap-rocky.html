Because in previous relationships, I tried and tried and tried my best, and you still feel like it’s not enough.” She continued, “So when someone sees you completely, and believes in you, and thinks you’re worthy of being the mother of their kids, it’s a great feeling. I felt the same about him. I knew he would be a great dad.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Ottenberg asked how many more kids she may want with her partner, Rihanna said simply: “As many as God wants me to have.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added, “I don’t know what God wants, but I would go for more than two. I would try for my girl.
