It began to go wrong when Harry was pictured coming out of my house one morning."</p><p id=eJd9znGUtgU data-wc=28>She continued: "And once that was out, it was open season. After that anyone could say anything. In the street people started shouting at me 'pedophile' and 'pervert.'"</p><p id=e02vajkfsLc data-wc=34>Flack died by suicide in 2020.
