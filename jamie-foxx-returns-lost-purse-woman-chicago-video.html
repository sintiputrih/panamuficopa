This time, the 55-year-old actor was recorded returning a lost purse to a woman on the streets of Chicago while she road in the back of a pedicab. The woman’s son, an Atlanta-based barber named <strong>Quan Ellis</strong>, shared the video of the exciting interaction on Instagram late on Monday night, July 10. Seen below,<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> the video</a> shows<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Jamie looking chipper</a> and healthy as he got back into his black SUV after delivering the purse. As the group of thrilled fans thanked him, he smiled at them, flashing a hang loose sign. He also seemingly said something along the lines of, “I saved your purse, baby!”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>(function () {var zergnet = document.createElement('script');zergnet.type = 'text/javascript';zergnet.async = true;zergnet.src = (document.location.protocol == 'https:' ?
