And seeing as dwarfism representation in film is hard to come by without veering into caricature-adjacent territory, it’s disheartening that the opportunity wasn’t taken.</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>I have but one thing to add: when it comes to issues faced by a certain demographic, prioritize listening to those who occupy that demographic.
