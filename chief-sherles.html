I'm the <span class=sc>Chief</span> of police in this town. Are you two travelers?"</i> <b>Yes</b>: <i>"This town's descended into a state of lawless chaos. I couldn't guarantee your safety if anything were to happen."</i> <b>No</b>: <i>"I see. Well, whether you are or not, it would be best if you were to get out of the town as soon as possible."</i><ul><li>Windmill Shed</li></ul><i>"<span class=sc>Chief</span>! Are you all right?!"</i><ul><li>After defeating Miror B.</li></ul><i>"I'm here, <span class=sc>Johnson</span>... That story isn't new. I've heard about it over and over already. "</i> <i>"You two have sure done it! I just got word from one of <span class=sc>Duking</span>'s people. So, you wiped out <span class=sc>Miror B.</span> and his gang. Thank you. On behalf of our whole town, I want to thank you two. But there's also bad news. Headquarters warns that there is a mysterious organization that is plotting world domination. I don't know if it has any connection to <span class=sc>Miror B.</span>, but you should be careful. Don't do anything reckless."</i><ul><li>After defeating Dakim</li></ul><i>"I'm here, <span class=sc>Johnson</span>... That story isn't new. Why are all of your reports so out of date all the time?"</i> <i>"I reckon that <span class=sc>Miror B.</span> was sent by that mystery organization in the first place."</i> <i>"If my guess is true, there ought to be more of his kind. If I hear anything on my end, I'll surely let you know. You're &lt;player>, right? What's your P★DA number?"</i> <i>"Okay, got it. You take care!"</i> <i>"Subject: <span class=sc>Miror Peon nabbed!</span> &lt;player>, It's Sherles. We've just apprehended a pair of thugs we believe to be <span class=sc>Miror B.</span>'s underlings. We may be able to lean on them for information. We have them locked up, so hurry over to <span class=sc>Pyrite</span>."</i><ul><li>Returning to Pyrite Jail</li></ul><i>"Hmm... Those suspects we arrested haven't spilled any beans. Not a thing! I reckon they're afraid of payback from their organization. I'll be in touch with you just as soon as I hear anything."</i><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_XD:_Gale_of_Darkness></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_XD:_Gale_of_Darkness>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</span></h3>Pyrite Town <i>"I'm <span class=sc>Sherles</span>, the <span class=sc>Chief</span> of <span class=sc>Pyrite Police</span>. Are you a traveling <span class=sc>Trainer</span>? The town has become peaceful, but there are still plenty of roughnecks around. They know how to keep us busy, what with their brawling and so on.
