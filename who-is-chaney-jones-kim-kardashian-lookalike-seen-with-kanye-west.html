After <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> was spotted spending time with <strong>Chaney Jones</strong> multiple times this month, fans <a href=#>have been in awe of the striking resemblance</a> between the model and his estranged wife, <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>.</p><p>The rapper, 44, and the Instagram influencer have been <a href=#>photographed</a> spending time together in Miami, where West held another Donda 2 event on Tuesday, February 22.</p><p>Most recently, the pair were photographed on Thursday, February 24, shopping together in Bar Harbour, where Jones seemed to take the <a href=#><strong>Jay-Z</strong></a>/<a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a>/<strong>West</strong> <a href=#>“Run This Town” lyric,</a> “All black everything,” to heart. She sported a form-fitting black catsuit complete with black sneakers and a black purse.
