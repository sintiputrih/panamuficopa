Hbo Abruptly Axes the Weeknd & Lily-Rose Depp's Hot Series! 1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><strong>The Idol Cancelled:</strong> <strong>HBO</strong> has decided to cancel the provocative drama series “<strong>The Idol</strong>,” which featured <strong>Lily-Rose Depp</strong> and The Weeknd in starring roles. The show, which premiered in June of this year, will no longer continue.</p><p><strong>HBO’s “The Idol</strong>” didn’t make it to a second season, as <strong>HBO</strong> announced the <strong>show’s cancellation on Monday. Entertainment</strong> Weekly has confirmed through a recent report that the <strong>HBO drama</strong>, starring <strong>Lily-Rose</strong> Depp and Abel Tesfaye, also known as The Weeknd, will not continue after its first season. The series revolved around a young pop star named <strong>Jocelyn,</strong> portrayed by <strong>Lily-Rose,</strong> who becomes entangled with a secret cult led by <strong>Tedros,</strong> <strong>The Weeknd’s character.</strong></p><h2>HBO’s Statement about the Cancellation</h2><p><strong>An HBO spokesperson</strong> informed <strong>Entertainment</strong> <strong>Weekly</strong>, “The Idol was one of <strong>HBO’s</strong> most thought-provoking original programs, and we’re pleased with the enthusiastic audience response. After careful consideration, both <strong>HBO</strong> and the creators and producers have collectively decided not to pursue a second season. We extend our gratitude to the creators, cast, and crew for their exceptional work.”</p><h2>Details about “The Idol”</h2><p>The show featured a cast including The <strong>Weeknd, Lily-Rose Depp, Dan Levy</strong>, <strong>BLACKPINK’s Jennie, Rachel Sennott, Hari Nef</strong>, <strong>Hank Azaria, Jane Adams, and Da’Vine Joy Randolph</strong>. “The Idol” followed the dark and seemingly reality-inspired tale of a renowned singer who aspired to become the “greatest and most alluring pop star in <strong>America</strong>.” Her life takes a turn when she becomes involved with a nightclub owner and cult leader with a troubled history.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.rallshe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-idol-cancelled-1.jpg alt="the idol cancelled" width=1500 height=900 title="The Idol Cancelled: Shocking!

Reports had emerged a year prior, hinting at issues behind the scenes, including the departure of a director, cast member, and significant reshoots at a different location.</p><p>This had generated mostly negative buzz around the show. Co-created by <strong>The Weeknd, Reza Fahim, and Sam Levinson</strong>, the creator of “Euphoria,” the drama premiered amid controversies regarding its overhaul after director Amy Seimetz left the project.</p><p>Rolling Stone conducted an interview with crew members and sources close to the production of “The Idol” in March, unveiling allegations of a toxic work environment, the show’s violent and disturbing content, and a departure from its original concept. Despite these claims, the cast refrained from criticizing the series.</p><p>Instead, the actors expressed praise. <strong>Da’Vine Joy Randolph</strong>, who portrayed Jocelyn’s manager, Destiny, mentioned in a June interview with Variety that there had been discussions about a potential second season due to <strong>HBO’s</strong> satisfaction with the series. She stated, “The intention is to have a second season. This wasn’t meant to be a limited series. <strong>HBO</strong> is content with it — to the extent that rumors of our cancellation circulated, and <strong>HBO took</strong> to <strong>Twitter</strong> [to address the rumors], which is rare for them. While nothing is official, <strong>HBO seems pleased</strong>.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Bronx Murder Case: Suspect Arrested in Connection with Mother’s Killing</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s63LpaqhnV6YvK5706GcZqGUpLlur8Cnmp6knJqxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
