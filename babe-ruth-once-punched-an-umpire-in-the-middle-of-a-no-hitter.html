It was in fact a relatively new ballpark, built in 1912 (via <a href=#>Britannica</a>). While tales of what happened at Fenway Park in June 1917 are usually headlined by Ruth, the truth of the matter is he was a bit player in a stellar pitching performance by Red Sox right-hander Ernie Shore&nbsp;(via <a href=#>Baseball Reference</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>Once everything had settled down after Ruth's outburst, there was a baseball game to play. Jack Berry tapped Shore to take the Bambino's place on the mound, where he faced his first batter, Washington third basemen Eddie Foster. According to <a href=#>Baseball Reference</a>, Shore recorded just two strikeouts, which meant that he had to rely on his and his teammates fielding ability to prevent any Senators from getting a hit. The <a href=#>Boston Globe</a>&nbsp;writes that&nbsp;Shore himself had to field several bunt attempts en route to a 4-0 Sox win. According to the <a href=#>MLB</a>, some regarded this as a perfect game for Shore, but technically, since Ray Morgan had gotten on base via a Babe Ruth Walk, it's recorded as a combined no-hitter, even though Shore himself had a perfect game.</p><p>Coincidentally, years later, with both pitchers members of the New York Yankees, Ruth went into the stands to confront a heckler, who then pulled a knife on him. Shore has been credited by some as being responsible for breaking up the fight, though Ruth claimed it was Yankees owner Til Huston who did it (via <a href=#>Society for American Baseball Research</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCElXJwcW1fl66jsYyrrK2gXaS7pLGMqaynm5iasW6tzWaspqiZp7Jutc1mq6GdXaK2pbDLnmSonl2Weq%2B7jKGgrayVp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
