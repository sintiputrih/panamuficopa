If you write a lot of emails or other office documents, they keyboard and touchpad quality will easily outweigh other aspects; photo or video editing – or just viewing images and movies – will benefit from a better display; and those that carry their work around benefit from the battery life, sure, but the build quality, dimensions, and weight of a laptop are also going to be critical.</description></item><item><title>Was Jerry Springer Actually A Judge?</title><link>/was-jerry-springer-real-judge.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/was-jerry-springer-real-judge.html</guid><description>Jerry Springer took the necessary measures to be a legally authorized judge for his series, "Judge Jerry."
