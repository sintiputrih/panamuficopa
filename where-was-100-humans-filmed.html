Sammy unfortunately had to sell tickets he had to the World Cup in order to take the job, but we're glad he did.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>By the time the hosts had wrapped the experiments, Sammy explains he had, "for the first time in my life, the following thought: 'Man, I love my job'." When the show still hadn't released six months later, he learned that the network simply wanted "to shoot a few more things."</p><p>After a few more months of waiting and filming, he finally received an email from Netflix on Feb. 29 (leap day!) that the show would be released on March 13. "And there you have it," he writes.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was '100 Humans' filmed?</h2><p>When Netflix set out to cast the 100 humans they needed for their series of experiments, they made it clear to applicants that they needed to be located in Los Angeles, Calif. and free during the summer of 2018.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>2nd unit #squadgoals #100humans #netflix #work #setlife ü§òüèº</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Steven Curiel üá∫üá∏</a> (@stevencurielofficial) on Jul 2, 2018 at 4:13pm PDT</p></figure><p>Now that the show has aired, many sleuths have uncovered where exactly in the City of Angels the show was filmed, thanks, in part, to the helpful social media geotagging of certain posts.</p><p>Namely cameraman Steven Curiel, who worked on the show, tagged Cal State University Northridge in an Instagram post from the time he spent filming back in June and July 2018.
