This is crazy.’”</p><p>She added: “He wanted to tell me and wanted to share, but the older they get, the more quiet they get, so they keep it very close to them.”</p><p>That doesn’t mean that the “Naked With Catt Sadler” podcast host has given up. “I always want them to know that they can talk to me, so I’m always just like, ‘When I was your age…’” she told&nbsp;Us. “I try to connect with them in that sense and remind them that it’s fun to talk and you’re not alone and everybody goes through things at different stages. … I just try to make it very clear that whoever you are, whatever you are, whatever you’re going through is okay and it’s exploratory and you don’t have to figure it all out now. That’s part of being that age.”</p><p>She and her first ex-husband, college sweetheart <strong>Kyle Boyd</strong>, share Austin, 18, and Arion, 14. After their split, Sadler married British film producer <strong>Rhys David Thomas</strong>. The pair wed in 2011 and finalized their divorce in 2017.</p><p>Sadler also told Us on Wednesday that <a href=#>she and her longtime boyfriend <strong>Nick LaKind</strong> split</a> after more than a year of dating.</p><p>“I’m single,”she revealed. “I love my work. I’m building right now so much. I got my kids, so if it’s not really additive, then I’m like, ‘I’m okay.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>With reporting by Carly Sloane</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmaSperStw6Wcq6tdqbKmusCgnGarn6PAbrDOp6tmrJGhuG7Azmafnqpdlq%2BwwdNmnqKqnKh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
