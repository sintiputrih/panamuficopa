Essentially, collecting the latest and greatest cards is becoming a lot easier.</p><p>Spotlight Caches will change in-game every week and only appears for players who have passed a Collection Level of 500. You will receive a Spotlight Cache in place of a Collector's Cache every 120 Collection Levels, or every 10 Collector's Caches.</p><p>Each Spotlight Cache contains four cards, with you being given one of the four every time you open a Cache.</p><p><strong>Read more <a href=# rel=noopener>Marvel</a> news:</strong></p><p>The cards featured in the Cache will be made up of one brand new card and two pre-existing Series 4 or 5 cards, and one random Series 4 or 5 card.</p><p>Each time you open a Spotlight Cache, the other cards remain left inside, with equal odds of being picked. Collect them all and Spotlight Variants replace them in a new pool of cards to pick.</p><p>For those free-to-play Marvel Snap players among you (yes, you in the back), the development team has promised Spotlight Cache will be worth one Series 4 or 5 card nearly every week.</p><p>It took around a month to get just one Series 5 card previously, so the Spotlight Cache update is changing things for the better.</p><p>Thanks to the update, you’re sure to see more players using Series 4 and 5 cards online and more of you will be able to get the new cards more easily.</p><p><strong>Subscribe to our <a href=# rel=noopener>free Gaming Newsletter</a> for weekly insights, and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">follow us on Twitter</a> for all the latest updates.</strong></strong></p><p><strong>Looking for something to watch?
