The WWE Hall of Famer has wrestled in multiple promotions. Of course, he is the only one to win an Olympic Gold medal with a broken freakin’ neck. He has mentioned on multiple occasions that one of the people that helped him become one of the greatest professional wrestlers was Vince McMahon.</p><p>Recently, the <a href=#>Olympic Gold Medalist</a> was interviewed by infamous British YouTuber <a href=#>True Geordie</a>. During the interview, Kurt Angle opened up about Vince McMahon. Angle claimed that back then, and to this day he sees the Chairman of WWE as a father figure.</p><p>“You know what? From the first day that I met him, till today, even though… even when we weren’t talking, even when things weren’t going so well for me and I felt like he could have done more for me, I always looked at him as a father figure.

Vince controlled my pro wrestling. I looked up to him as a father figure. And I respected Vince, I loved him. And so I still feel that way to this day. He gave me an opportunity and I took it.
