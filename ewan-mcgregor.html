The getting married bit, of course, took place in real life rather than on the silver screen.</p><p id=ezGPvo9IYq data-wc=82>A Scot and enthusiastic patriot, Ewan Gordon McGregor was born on March 31, 1971, in the quiet market town of Crieff, Perthshire. Fascinated by acting, as a child he worshipped his uncle actor and director Denis Lawson, perhaps best known as the multi-talented hotel owner in who often popped up from London to visit the McGregor household. With acting in his blood, Ewan's decision to leave school at 16 to join Perth Repertory Theatre was wholeheartedly supported by his parents.&nbsp;</p><h2>His Career</h2><p id=eVMIgchb0yp data-wc=37>At 18, the rising star was accepted into London's prestigious Guildhall School of Music and Drama and soon established himself as a young prodigy, going straight into Dennis Potter's Channel 4 TV series .</p><p id=eHjPahsRYCN data-wc=45>Ewan's first notable film role was that of cynical hack Alex Law in the low-budget but critically acclaimed thriller The film marked the start of a highly successful partnership between the actor and the Danny Boyle, John Hodge and Andrew MacDonald production team.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1jZgffN8DE data-wc=48>The drug-fuelled was their next big project together, and a starring role opposite <a aria-label='\"Biography' class=hm-link href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> in followed soon after. The trio's relationship with Ewan foundered, however, when the studio decided to cast <a aria-label='\"Biography' class=hm-link href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> instead of the Scottish star in 2000's .</p><h2>His Family Life</h2><p id=enqL3SG9Mgf data-wc=61>Almost immediately after completing Ewan married French production designer Eve Mavrakis. "I did a lot of the initial chasing and we both then chased each other around London for a while," he says. No sooner was the wedding over then Ewan was back at work, filming the costume drama and there seemed to be no stopping his back-to-back projects.</p><p id=eWeGDc22x3G data-wc=96>The newlyweds completed their own collaborative effort a year later with the birth of their first daughter Clara.Clara's brush with death after a bout of meningitis in 1997, while Ewan was in LA, led the actor to greatly reduce his schedule and taught him how much his family means to him. The couple's second child, Esther, arrived in 2001. When he was offered the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the first of the long-promised prequels to the trilogy he accepted the project with the same sang-froid with which he had taken on other roles.&nbsp;</p><p id=eAA8zHH0xwe data-wc=76>He was thrilled to be in the film, however, exclaiming at the time, "I've been waiting nearly 20 years to have my own light sabre. Nothing's cooler than being a Jedi knight. "Mega-stardom beckoned, but Ewan preferred to play it cool, starring in low-budget films. He was also busy helping form the production company Natural Nylon intended as an antidote to big-buck Hollywood projects with friends <a aria-label='\"Biography' class=hm-link href=#>Jonny Lee Miller</a>, Sean Pertwee, <a aria-label='\"Biography' class=hm-link href=#>Jude Law</a> and Sadie Frost.</p><p id=eceLBexv12d data-wc=58>The handsome star was tempted back into the Hollywood limelight by a starring role opposite <a aria-label='\"Biography' class=hm-link href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> in Baz Luhrmann's And he followed the all-singing all-dancing musical with - which earned an Academy Award nomination for director Ridley Scott in 2002 - sharing the screen with Sam Shephard, Tom Sizemore and Josh Hartnett.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9vaGNksritzWaknJ%2BimrSwvo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
