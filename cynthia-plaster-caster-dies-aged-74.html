He was my first real rock star that dipped his d*** and it was unbelievable.</p><p>“We were the groupies that got to the hotel first and we were the only groupies in Jimi Hendrix’s room. It wasn’t our very first cast. I had tried it on a few civilians first to be ready for Jimi.</p><p>“He’s my biggest. No, he’s not my biggest. There are ‘bigger-ish’ others. But, I couldn’t say whether or not he’s my most exciting. Because they’re my sweet babies and I am their mama and I’m very democratic with all my babies. I don’t like to play favourites. I love them all. The experiences were equally exciting and weird and different from each other.”</p><p>Cynthia was honoured in the song ‘Plaster Caster’ that featured on the 1977 KISS album ‘Love Gun’ although rock legend Gene Simmons was never one of her subjects.</p><p>It included the lyrics: “The plaster’s gettin’ harder and my love is perfection/ A token of my love for her collection.”</p><p>Cynthia’s career was immortalised in the 2001 documentary ‘Plaster Caster’ and she also featured in the 2005 BBC documentary ‘My Penis and I’ – created by the filmmaker Lawrence Barraclough about his anxiety over the size of his penis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnLCnrJierm68y5qqrZ2iYrCiv9OeqWacmZrAbq3Gnptmb2Rk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
