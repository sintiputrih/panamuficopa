That’s just reality, but that doesn’t mean we want to stick with casual canvas every time we need to carry more than our wallet and keys around with us. If our crossbody can be chic, we want our tote to be too. Just . . . maybe not three times the price.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Dreubea Women’s Soft Leather Tote Shoulder Bag</a> is one of the highest quality bags we’ll find, period. It’s not thousands, or even hundreds of dollars, though. It’s less than $20, and no one would ever guess, but it’s available right from Amazon!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Bags.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Dreubea Women’s Soft Leather Tote Shoulder Bag</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$16</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, May 31, 2019, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>Over 1,000 reviewers are freaking out over the value of this faux-leather tote. Even those who own several high-end, designer bags say this is amongst their very favorite — and that’s just in one color. Other reviewers are saying how they plan to buy one to go with every outfit. Luckily they have nearly 40 options! It’s not surprising to see that there were some skeptics out there, unable to believe that such an affordable bag could be so great, but they were all happy to admit they were proven wrong!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">This lightweight shoulder bag</a> is made of a soft and textured leather-look material. If we look through the colors, we’ll also find a couple of “new style” bags with a smoother and shinier leather. We love both equally! This bag has two top handles that are stitched on, making them not only comfortable to carry, but sturdy and strong. Hanging off one of the handles is an adorable tassel, matching in both color and material to the handle and rest of the bag!</p><p>This tote has a magnetic button closure. Open it up to reveal the large main compartment, as well as a smaller slip pocket! Shoppers say they love this slip pocket for storing smaller essentials like their phone, earbuds, keys and a pack of gum. As for the bigger pocket, the options are truly vast!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Maroon-Bag.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Dreubea Women’s Soft Leather Tote Shoulder Bag</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$16</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, May 31, 2019, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>What we store in the main compartment will depend on where we’re heading. We can stick a tablet, a planner, a book and a water bottle inside for work or school, or we can instead opt for sunscreen, sunglasses and a cover-up for a trip to the beach, as one shopper recommended. There’s always room for more, too!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">This bag</a> is also great for overnight trips when we don’t want to schlep around a duffel or suitcase. It’s definitely more sophisticated than a canvas backpack, too! We’d also recommend this tote as a great <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> for friends. Fill it with candies and cosmetics for an extra special surprise!</p><p>As we mentioned, this number one bestseller comes in nearly 40 colors, with matte shades as well as metallic gold, silver and bronze finishes. We know it’s unreasonable to own them all . . . but is it? We’re more than willing to change our mind!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Dreubea Women’s Soft Leather Tote Shoulder Bag</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$16</a> at Amazon!
