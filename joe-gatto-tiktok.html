It's well-known that Q, Murr, and Sal typically get a bit more flustered than Joe does. The 44-year-old is unafraid to strip down to his skivvies, spray mashed potatoes at strangers, and disappoint the heck out of 14,000 Imagine Dragons' fans by pretending to be the world's worst opening act. The man will do literally anything to make the world laugh, often at his own expense.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> may actually be the perfect platform for someone like Joe. But if you're expecting Joe to be making TikToks that look like Impractical Jokers punishments, honestly, you might be a little disappointed. But if you're here for wholesome family content, then you've definitely come to the right place.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Joe has brought the whole Gatto family onto TikTok.</h2><p>Joe's TikTok persona is basically a cool uncle with a passion for dad jokes. Case in point, the TikTok in which he shows off his favorite quarantine-friendly spots during the COVID-19 pandemic, set to Lil Jon's "Get Low" — the window and the wall. Get it? Come on, that's prime dad joke material.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@the_joe_gatto href=#>@the_joe_gatto</a><p>My fave spots during <a title=coronavirus href=#>##Coronavirus</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - bessygatto" href=#>♬ original sound - bessygatto</a></figure><p>Joe often has his wife, Bessy, guest star in his posts. Bessy, by the way, has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her own account</a> that you should go check out. She's far more active than Joe is, and the self-described "38 year old mom pretending to know what Im doing" is so relatable. Both Joe and Bessy make a lot of their videos with their two kids, Remington and Milana.&nbsp;</p><p>But Joe also frequently makes videos with his nieces and nephews as well, although his nieces have discovered a side of TikTok that they really, really, really did not need or want to see. When Talia, Eliza, and Jolie spotted a video in which a TikToker joked about which Impractical Joker they wanted to have sex with, the nieces posted their reaction — and Joe added in his own.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@the_joe_gatto href=#>@the_joe_gatto</a><p>This app can make things awkward. <a title=duet href=#>##duet</a> with @taliatardogno</p><a title="♬ The Election of 1800 - Daveed Diggs & Okieriete Onaodowan & Leslie Odom Jr. & Lin-Manuel Miranda & Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton" href=#>♬ The Election of 1800 - Daveed Diggs & Okieriete Onaodowan & Leslie Odom Jr. & Lin-Manuel Miranda & Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton</a></figure><p>By the way, those nieces are not the only ones he has. Another one of his nephews, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sal</a>, even is a bit of a TikTok celebrity all on his own.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Joe's TikTok is filled with family-friendly (and dog-friendly) content.</h2><p>Joe's content is overall pretty wholesome and family-friendly. Save for one video partaking in the <a href=#>Wipe It Down Challenge</a>, in which the comedian appears on the toilet, you're not going to find anything on his page that you wouldn't want your kids watching. In this strange time where we're social distancing away from others, Joe has become more active on his page, posting uplifting content, like one TikTok in which he compiled videos of himself popping into high school Zoom classes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@the_joe_gatto href=#>@the_joe_gatto</a><p>I met a lot of cool kids yesterday while crashing Zoom HS classes.
