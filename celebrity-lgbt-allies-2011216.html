Whether celebrities are outspoken like <a href=#><strong>Lady Gaga</strong></a>, extremely supportive like <a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a> or ready to fight back on social media like <a href=#><strong>Marlon Wayans</strong></a>, many are vocal about their dedication to the LGBTQ community.</p><p>Wayans, who is a proud father of an openly gay daughter named Amai, isn’t afraid to share her story. During Pride Month in June 2019, the Scary Movie actor posted a heartfelt tribute to Amai and was<a href=#> quick to hit back</a> when he received backlash from some followers.</p><p>“Happy pride to my pride and joy,” Wayans captioned a sweet Instagram picture of his girl. “I wouldn’t change one effing thing about you. Love you to the moon around the sun through the galaxies and back again.”</p><p>And when one troll took the comments section saying his daughter wasn’t “old enough” to understand her sexuality, papa bear’s claws came out.</p><p>“She’s 19,” the White Chicks star quipped back. “She’s who she is until or until she don’t [sic] choose different. Love her for her not what I want her to be.” He also explained why it was important for him to address trolls about the topic.</p><p>“I thought of erasing [the derogatory comments] but I need the world to see the ignorance that still exists,” the actor explained. “Objective without obstacles is a worthless triumph. We all will some day get to unconditional love. Because of my daughter I am one step closer. I am not God, i don’t judge i just LOVE. And still pray for the haters because i refuse to judge them too just love.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gaga, meanwhile,<a href=#> often speaks out</a> about her “moral obligation” to defend gay rights and accept people for who they are. Cyrus, for her part, <a href=#>has been a huge advocate</a> of the LGBT community for years, even declaring in 2015 that she is pansexual — which means gender and biological sex are not factors in her love life.</p><p>Scroll down to see which other famous faces stand with the LGBT community!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BYsq2xwaugrbFdobSjwIyao6Whlah6c3yQamlqbl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
