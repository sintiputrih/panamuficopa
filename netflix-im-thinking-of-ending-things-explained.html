Jake disappears inside the school, leading Lucy to go looking for him. The story is interspersed with an old janitor going about his day-to-day job at the high school who encounters Lucy, saying he didn't know where her boyfriend was but is later seen pulling off his clothes and hallucinates seeing an animated pig, <strong>who tells him to follow him through the school. &nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ei5GJ8lCUnI9><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/81d8f7388218-thinking-of-ending-things-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=ec_UdIZ2Yegw data-wc=12><strong>Who is the janitor?

Instead, he invents a relationship with her, which explains why her name, occupation and the story of how they first met rapidly changes throughout the film as he tries to imagine her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f6f7c0b26314-jake-ending-things-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eWLv9EaiEJdu data-wc=13><strong>The story follows Jake as he takes his girlfriend to visit his parents</strong></p><p id=e4YIUPdo5wIJ data-wc=29>Similarly, <strong>when Lucy is certain she's seen a photograph of herself on the wall </strong>and it's actually of Jake, this makes sense as they are both the same person.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHHHm6SzVDO- data-wc=66>Jake - who is the old janitor seen throughout the film - lives through his memories, and so sees his parents in every stage of their lives as he remembers them, now long gone. <strong>The ballet dance shows, once again, an imagined romance with Lucy which follows the storyline of Oklahoma!, the musical,&nbsp;</strong>that the teenagers at his school were seen rehearsing earlier in the film.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/15680e87855d-toni-collette-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eA2FV-IQ0s_c data-wc=11><strong>Jake is remembering his parents at different stages of their lives</strong></p><p id=e7nOWJQvOb12 data-wc=36>His final speech, being from also hints at how he is imagining his life through the literature, TV shows and movies which are referenced throughout the film during Lucy and Jake's long conversations.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSexaxwll-Eb data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Death on the Nile trailer is here and it's the best thing you'll see all day</a></strong></p><p id=e0z5VHXcunHK data-wc=33>The constant line, 'I'm thinking of ending things', while we were meant to believe was about whether Lucy wanted to end things with her boyfriend, <strong>was actually about Jake ending his own life.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
