However, the two take also help from different experts as they turn abandoned houses into stunning dreaming homes. In Season 6 Episode 12 of the show, the couple took help from a local artist named Vixon Sullivan.</p><p>Let’s learn about Vixon’s Home Town stint, his career, personal life, and more in the wiki article below.</p><h3><strong>Vixon Sullivan On Home Town</strong></h3><p>As Home Town viewers saw during Season 5 Episode 12, A House For Mom and Dad, Erin enlisted the help of pottery artist Vixon Sullivan for the project she was working on.</p><p>A little before his episode went on air, Vixon also made a post on Instagram and Facebook and asked his fans and followers to look for him on that day’s episode. His exact captions were: ‘Do y’all watch #HGTVHomeTown? Either way, Look for me on tonight’s episode. I will be showing @erinapier how I make a coil constructed vase and yes, she is as nice as she seems on tv! Watch with me at 8/7 ct on @HGTV or anytime on @discoveryplus.’</p><p>Following his appearance on the show, many viewers also took to Twitter to share some wonderful words about Vixon’s talent. One person wrote, “Wow! Vixon Sullivan is such a talented pottery artist!,” whereas another one wrote, “That pottery by Vixon Sullivan was some of the most beautiful I’ve ever seen.”</p><h3><strong>Vixon Sullivan Age</strong></h3><p>According to Vixon Sullivan’s Instagram, the pottery artist was 32 years of age in April 2022. He celebrates his birthday on the 27th of August every year.</p><h3><strong>Is Vixon Sullivan On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Vixon Sullivan is on Instagram <a href=#>@vixonsullivan</a> and he had 5.1 thousand followers on the platform as of April 2022. As any artist would, Vixon also showcases his work on Instagram. He has made 432 posts as of this writing and his pottery works can be seen on his feed all the way back to 2013.</p><p>You can also find him on Facebook, Pinterest, and Etsy.</p><h3><strong>Vixon Sullivan Family</strong></h3><p>Vixon Sullivan is very close to his parents and feels that he would never make a career as an artist had he not had any support from them.</p><p>On May 28, 2015, Vixon posted a picture with his mom and dad, and called them his ‘best friends.’</p><p>Vixon’s parents also assist him in the studio space, a place where Vixon creates and stores his artwork. Although Vixon never thought he would have his parents in his job place, he’s happy to see his passion transform into a family business of sorts.</p><p>Some of Vixon’s other family members include Luther Patton, Kameron Peyton, Sarah Sutton, and Alexa Sutton.</p><h3><strong>Vixon Sullivan Career/Work</strong></h3><p>Reportedly, Vixon was creative from a young age. Even as a child, he used to create things for decorations. While art was something he would enjoy a lot doing, he never took it as more than a hobby.</p><p>Vixon did his undergraduate studies at The University of Southern Mississippi. He graduated from there with a degree in advertising and a minor in art. Upon graduation, his first job was as a media consultant. However, he always drew portraits as a side hustle.</p><p>Sometime later, the Home Town star realized that advertising was not something he could do for a long time. As soon as the realization hit Vixon, he resigned from his job and decided to become a full-time artist.</p><p>As a full-time artist, Vixon started to create pieces that people could use on a daily basis. He thought while portraits were a beautiful thing to create, the whole process was time-consuming. From then and there, he switched his focus to making beautiful ceramic essentials, which include coffee cups, mugs and vases, and other household items. On top of that, he also personalized those items uniquely so that people would immediately recognize the given item was his creation.</p><p>To increase productivity, Vixon also bought a kiln and studio to create and store his works.</p><p>Vixon sells his artworks through his own business website (<a href=#>Vixon Sullivan Art</a>). According to the website, the company’s mission is to “provide masterful works of art and exceptional service. We aim to impact gifting culture by crafting treasures that inspire joy in life’s everyday moments and special occasions.”</p><h3><strong>Is Vixon Sullivan Married?</strong></h3><p>If Vixon Sullivan’s Facebook is anything to go by, he was not married as of April 2022. The incredible artist has written ‘single’ under the Relationship section of his Facebook.</p><p>That being said, Vixon Sullivan is not gay as he has made clear on his Facebook that he is interested only in Facebook, which further implies, that if Vixon finds a woman who shares his interest and passion in the near future he may take no time to get married to that special woman.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Vixon Sullivan From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Home Town star Vixon Sullivan is originally from Hattiesburg, Mississippi.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Vixon Sullivan?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Vixon Sullivan stands at an average height of 5 feet 10 inches.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpp2VqXqxu9OtnKuxXaKurLHRZq2isJ%2BjerTBy6Wgr5meYrOzu8xmn6CspmK1sLnEZquor55k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
