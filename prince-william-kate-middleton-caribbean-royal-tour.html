In addition to marking Will and Kate's first joint official overseas tour since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the visit to Jamaica echos the monarch's first visit to Jamaica when she was a new queen 70 years ago.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The tour will also see the royal couple bring sentiments from the monarch to the people of the Caribbean, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/royals/kate-middleton-and-prince-williams-caribbean-royal-tour-details-revealed/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">People</a>. A source also told the outlet that the queen will be watching the tour with interest from her home at Windsor Castle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"These are three countries with which Her Majesty has had an extremely warm relationship following multiple visits throughout her reign," a palace spokeswoman says. "Those trips have helped to provide inspiration for many of the engagements that Their Royal Highnesses will carry out during their tour."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"As well as thanking the people of Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas for their support, across this eight-day tour, the Duke and Duchess's program will focus on celebrating the rich cultures that are unique to these three countries," the spokeswoman adds.</p><img alt="jamaica november 01 jamaica, kingston, kenneth kennedy o connor knighted by the queen elizabeth ii in november 1953 photo by keystone francegamma keystone via getty images" title="Jamaica, Kingston, Kenneth Kennedy O Connor Knighted By The Queen Elizabeth Ii In November 1953." width=1600 height=2006 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-106757945-1647714273.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Keystone-France</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Queen Elizabeth during her 1953 trip to Jamaica.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Belize portion of the tour has had a recent schedule change, with the duke and duchess canceling one of their first outings. The pair will skip a planned visit to a cocoa farm in on the foothills of the country's Maya Mountains Sunday, after Indian Creek villagers staged a protest Saturday regarding colonialism and the use of a football field by the royals for landing their helicopter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Indian Creek was one of several sites being considered.

Per the outlet, Kensington Palace declined to comment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After three nights in Belize, the couple will continue to Jamaica, where they will celebrate the "seminal legacy of Bob Marley," per the palace. They will then head to the Bahamas to take part in The Bahamas Platinum Jubilee Sailing Regatta at the Royal Sailing Club in Nassau. The club was close to the heart of the late Prince Philip, who was a Honorary Commodore then Honorary Life Member of the sailing club.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both Prince William and Duchess Kate will also take time to champion their causes on the trip.
