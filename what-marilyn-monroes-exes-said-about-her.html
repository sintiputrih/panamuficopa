A musician and vocal coach in Hollywood in the 1950s, Schaefer originally met Monroe when he was hired to help her sing better for the film "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,"&nbsp;according to <a href=#>"Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe."</a>&nbsp;She requested him as her vocal coach on several films after that. Schaefer remembered,&nbsp;"She struck me as kind of fey, as not being altogether in this world, not all there. She was quiet, didn't open up much. At first she had no confidence, but she reacted to my teaching and she got better. ... she really became quite good..."</p><p>Spending so much time together eventually led to an intimate relationship, which was a problem, since Monroe was married to Joe Dimaggio at that time, and he was an extremely, even dangerously, jealous man. Schaefer found himself threatened, followed, and bugged in order for Dimaggio's&nbsp;associates to get information on their relationship. Schaefer ended up attempting suicide, after which, Monroe nursed him back to health. But their relationship would not survive.</p><p>As for why it happened in the first place?&nbsp;"I think she regarded it as her function, being this great attractive female, that she was supposed to have sex with a man, because that was something she could do, that she could give," Shaefer said.</p><p>If you or anyone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline​ by dialing 988 or by calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255)​.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kW9pcGpoZMSprdNmpJqqmaHGr3nMqKWrp5WoeqbExKxkrJmZmXqirs6uq2aglad8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
