With 11 American-produced series and 21 international adaptations, the franchise’s success is no secret. But all that success doesn’t come without controversy, and <strong>The Real Housewives of New York </strong>season 13 proved that statement far too true.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=590 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>After an underperforming season drowned out by controversy involving Ramona Singer and Luann de Lesseps, Bravo decided to completely reboot RHONY for its 14th season. Bringing in an entirely new cast, producer Andy Cohen made it clear a key decision in casting was the diversity of this group. In an interview with Variety back in 2022, Cohen said “We are searching for a multicultural group of friends who really best reflect the most exciting city in the country. We’re looking for a group of women who are real friends, and who are of diverse backgrounds, races and religions.”</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>When <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the cast was revealed</a> in October 2022, it was clear Cohen meant what he said. RHONY season 14 easily boasts the most diverse cast in the show’s history. But of course, they’re not there for the sake of showing off diversity in NYC. They’re there to show off the elite upper circles of the city, and what it’s like to live the life of the 1 percent.
