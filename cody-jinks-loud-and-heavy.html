In fact, the singer said his son “got half the writer’s rights on that song.”</p><p>Definitely one of <a href=#>Cody Jinks’ greatest hits</a>, and his most streamed song, “Loud and Heavy,” finds the revolutionary Texas country-rocker singing about the complications of life. He used rain and thunderstorm as a figure of speech, which has been a common comparison for life’s most unexpected moment – whether it’s great or terrible – like how a flash of lightning can come out of nowhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href=#>Cody Jinks and wife Rebecca: Partners In Love And Music</a></p><p>The most moving part came in the song’s refrain, which details the thin line we all walk with our emotions and the complicated situation of settling how we feel.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Story Behind The Song&nbsp;</h2><p>Interestingly, “Loud and Heavy” came to life during a car ride with his son to a Tractor Supply Company – a destination his son requested, wanting to see a tractor up close. Unfortunately, it began to rain so heavily that Papa Jinks told his son, “Hey buddy, there’s a lot of loud thunder and heavy rain out there.”</p><p>And the little boy couldn’t help but only say “loud thunder heavy rain” again and again – which eventually became the song’s hook.</p><p>In 2018, Jinks launched his self-curated <a href=# rel=noopener>Loud and Heavy Fest</a> in his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas. It features a lineup the former thrash-metal singer hand-picked himself, including Colter Wall, Whitey Morgan, Sunny Sweeney, among others. Most of the bands present at the festivals have toured or worked with Jinks, too.</p><p>While there was a forty-minute delay due to high humidity and a smattering of rainy sprinkles, it never stood a chance against the determination of roughly 8,000 fans.</p><p>Anyway, you can listen to “Loud and Heavy” by <a href=#>Cody Jinks</a> in the video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-2854"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-2854"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursaSdrq%2Bzw5qgpbFemLyue8Kom7Jlmp67rL%2BMpaaunF2Wu6V5x56Yr7Ff</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
