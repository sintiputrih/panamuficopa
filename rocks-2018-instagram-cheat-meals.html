He is not only the People’s Champion, but he is a shoo-in for the WWE Hall Of Fame. He also stays in remarkable shape.<br>Dwayne Johnson needs to keep a strict diet and exercise program to stay so jacked. This routine involves stepping out of his diet every now and then for a massive cheat meal.<br>If you follow The Great One on Instagram, then you’re aware of the fact that he often posts pictures of his cheat meals for all to see. We’re fascinated to see what the Brahma Bull is doing to cheat on his diet, and it’s even more interesting to see what he’s up to while consuming such a huge meal.<br>Therefore, we’ve collected all of The Rock’s Instagram cheat meals from 2018 (so far). Enjoy.<br><strong>January 29th</strong><br>The Rock started off the cheat meal year on January 29th. He loves brownies and cookies. You will see a lot more of those as time goes on. Needless to say, The Rock doesn’t do just normal brownies and cookies either.</p><p>“(I do share recipes in exchange for dirty jokes and tequila)<br>I make my cheat meals EPIC because, hell we all work hard and only live once.<br>Huge turkey subs – oven roasted turkey, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato onion and mayo on the side.<br>Huge fudge brownies with milk chocolate chips, natural peanut butter and fudge smothered and drizzled on top.<br>A beautiful night of decadence and sin and by 2am I was drenched in sugar sweats trying to sleep.<br>But much like the many addictions I have in my life – the going up is always worth the coming down. “</p><p>As you can see, Rocky also loves sandwiches. Sometimes it’s not fair how well he is able to describe the food he’s eating either. It’s like he’s auditioning for some kind of a cooking show.<br><br><strong>March 26th</strong><br>The Rock was too busy in February and most of March to post a cheat meal, He had Rampage business to take care of, but he destroyed some pancakes in a way that most mortal men wouldn’t dare. After such a hard day by 2:00 am, The Great One needed the fuel to carry on. All of this makes us wonder how he finds the time to sleep at all.</p><p>“Veni, vini, vici.<br>Well earned late Sunday night cheat meal.<br>Sush and banana, chocolate chip pancakes.<br>Hello sugar sweats by 2am.<br>#CameSawConquered”</p><p>This is a very impressive meal, but if you keep going on this list the best is yet to come in regards to the massive amount of food The Rock is able to consume.<br><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>June 18th</span></span></strong><br>The Rock enjoyed a mid-Summer cheat meal in a huge way while he had some laughs thanks to Ali Wong.</p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“It’s on – Sunday cheat meal.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Chocolate chip banana pancakes, syrup, peanut butter and&nbsp;@aliwong.

Thankfully, he has a team ready to help get him through his difficult itinerary. He also has plenty of food too.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>July 29th</span></span></strong><br>The Rock enjoys his sushi and he also loves his cookies in a big way. The Great One showed off his cheat meal while talking about his “succulent” meal in a way that could make anyone envious.</p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“*swipe left and witness the double main-eventer of cheat meals while I get my Netflix fix.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>6pm – the succulent sushi&nbsp;train rolls thru and right into my belly.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>11pm – homemade cheatin’ chocolate chip cookies &nbsp;with a one-way ticket to Holy Moses heaven by smearing peanut butter on every cookie before I destroy them.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>I know how to party.

It’s pretty interesting to be able to get a peek in on what kind of massive meals he’s consuming. He considers this “food porn” and it’s hard to argue with that.<br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>August 20th</span></span></strong><br>The Rock paid tribute to Garry Shandling while he ate a boatload of sushi. The secret sauce to success might be different for everyone. Thankfully, The Rock’s secret sauce has been enjoyed by millions and millions of his fans for decades.</p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“Sunday sushi express rolls along..</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>With a phenomenal doc on legendary comedian, Garry Shandling.

He is obviously a favorite of The Great One’s because he’s referenced Rogers a couple of times before.</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“1am and the cheat meal sushi train&nbsp;rolls along like an unstoppable force.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Despite the fact that I wound up passed out on the couch like a wounded buffalo after destroying sushi — this documentary WONT YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR? about the iconic “Mr. Rogers” is excellent.

This is good to hear and it is just one more thing he has in common with his millions and millions of his fans.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>September 24th</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>The Rock absolutely demolished a huge plate of sushi and then followed it up with too many </span></span><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>cookies to</span></span><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88> count. He has expensive tastes, but he can certainly afford it.</span></span><br><br><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>October 1st</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>It’s midnight for The Great One which means it’s all aboard the sushi train for Dwayne Johnson.

He described what he was eating in a way that would make anyone jealous as well. Then the Brahma Bull went on to put over Bob Marley making us wonder how he mustered up the extra hunger to destroy that plate of cookies.</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“Cheat meal cookie train rolls on.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Helluva sugar/ Netflix combo…</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>My tiny (and by tiny I mean f*cking ginormous) signature DJ double chocolate and peanut butter chip cookies with creamy peanut butter layered in the middle.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>And great doc about the icon Bob Marley and an assassination attempt made on his life in 1976.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Bob’s son, Rohan Marley was my teammate when we played ball together down at THE U.

He didn’t have much to say this time around, so he got right down to business&nbsp;with that sushi.</span></span></p><p>“Eyebrow raised and chopsticks &nbsp;ready.<br>The epic cheat meal&nbsp;#SundaySushiTrain&nbsp;&nbsp; rolls on.<br>And for the record, these chopsticks are personalized. I am not f*cking around<br>Enjoy your cheat meal my friends.&nbsp;#MyCrueGoesHard”</p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>It just goes to show that sometimes a picture is worth 1,000 words.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>October 29th</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>The Rock annihilated some brownies and cookies while he watched a documentary about hip-hop music. The Rock’s tastes are pretty eclectic&nbsp;which is why he’s still the People’s Champ.</span></span></p><p>“The Sunday cheat meal, “I have zero f*cks left to give”&nbsp;#CookieAndBrownieTrain&nbsp;rolls on.<br>My signature double milk chocolate and peanut butter chip with real peanut butter smeared in the middle, BUT this time with a twist – salted caramel chips. drop.<br>Colliding with one of the best doc series I’ve seen in a very long time, HIP HOP EVOLUTION.<br>Highly recommend, if you’re like me, a hard core fan of hip hop culture and history, or a struggling hip hop artist or if you’re already a global hip hop superstar.<br>A must watch.<br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>From that Miami bass bringin me back to my days at THE U (Uncle Luke/Uncle Al) to the hard core Texas boys (J Prince/Geto Boys/UGK) to that iconic LA Gangsta sound (Dre/NWA/OG Ice T) to that one and only G-Funk (Too Short / E-40) sound of the Bay (also where Tupac credits finding “his voice”) all the way back to the history of Afrika Bambaataa forming Zulu Nation to of course the undisputed originator of hip hop, New York City (Herc, Flash, KRS 1, Tribe, Wu etc). This doc is ridiculous.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>What’s also ridiculous is me devouring these gigantic MF’n cookies and bringing gluttony to a new level.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Enjoy your cheat meals my friends.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>You ain’t cheating if you ain’t eating “</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>I think there’s something to that “you ain’t cheating if you ain’t eating” line.

Yes, please, but The Rock will have two pies. He took that food to pound town in a big way as he continued to muse about his life. He also received some pretty interesting advice from his strength and conditioning coach which he shared as well.</span></span></p><p>“Midweek carb up and takin’ these sexy pizzas to pound town.<br>Before our big action scenes tomorrow for HOBBS & SHAW, I get that glorious text from my strength and conditioning coach&nbsp;@daverienzi&nbsp;that says, “for your big scene tomorrow we need to fill you out more.. need you to eat pizza tonight and shoot me pics from the gym in the morning” — it worked.<br>Muscle bellies are full, dense and striated.<br>Achieving and maintaining a certain aesthetic for months while filming is such a crazy science that requires constant strategy and a surgical eye from a great coach.<br>As scientific and intellectualized as this process can be – when you strip it all down to brass tacks, it basically means you gotta be f*cking nuts to constantly commit to this discipline.”</p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>The Rock is always game for new information on how to better himself. That’s how he continues improving. Those pizzas didn’t stand a chance though.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>November 19th</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>The Rock enjoyed a huge plate of sushi and then he let us know about his appreciation for the late great Johnny Cash. He quoted the legendary country singer while he slammed some sushi. That’s quite a picture.</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“The cheat meal Sunday Sushi Train rolled on this past weekend with some power and a ton of that wooosabi</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Great new doc on Netflix about one of my fav country artists, the icon himself, Johnny Cash.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>I wear the black for the poor and beaten down.. livin’ in the hopeless, hungry side of town.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>If you ain’t eatin’ – then you ain’t cheatin’. Enjoy your cheat meals my friends and excuse me while I take greed and gluttony to new levels.”</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Knowing some of the people The Rock draws inspiration from is a pretty cool little tidbit that he lets the fans in on. As Dwayne Johnson, he’s an even bigger star and has gone on to influence countless others outside of pro wrestling. It’s nice to know that even people like The People’s Champion have influences just like the rest of us.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>November 23rd</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Okay, so this is Thanksgiving so it shouldn’t count, but you’ve got to see this bird.</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“Word to the bird</span></span><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>&nbsp;and a weird thing I have to always keep close.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>This Thanksgiving was a unique one, in that it was the first time I’ve ever not been back home in the U.S. of A.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>But here in London, we still cooked and laid out a big, sweet spread to give our thanks and boundless gratitude for our loved ones.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>The weird thing – is every Thanksgiving I gotta take a moment to remember exactly 27 years ago on Thanksgiving while living in Tampa, Fl we were so piss broke, that we couldn’t even afford to buy a turkey, so we were praying someone would invite us over for Thanksgiving.</span></span><br>Well, the universe answered our prayers, because friends of ours called to say Happy Thanksgiving and we were like, “HAPPY THANKSGIVING WE’LL BE RIGHT OVER TO CELEBRATE WITH YOU GUYS K BYE!!” They were like, “Uhhh okaaaay great, see you soon?” A Very true and f*cking embarrassing story<br>I’m weird this way, but remembering sh*t like this helps me live a better and more grateful life.<br>I’m quite sure I need therapy for this, but until then tequila will be my loving & empathetic therapist.”</p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>What a great Thanksgiving story from The Rock.
