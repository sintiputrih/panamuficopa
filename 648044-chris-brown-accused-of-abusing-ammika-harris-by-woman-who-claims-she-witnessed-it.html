Her <a href=# rel>relationship with Chris Brown</a> is unclear as people assume they are together because they share an adorable son, Aeko Brown. However, Breezy doesn't speak about his private life, but he and Harris have been spotted enjoying quality time together. They were photographed last month in Paris and out and about for Valentine's Day. Harris was infamously involved in an altercation with <a href=# rel>Tommie Lee backstage</a> at Brown's concert in London; still, she's an elusive figure that keeps herself away from the fray of online conversations.</p><p>However, a woman shone a light on Brown and Harris. On Instagram, a woman emerged with damaging allegations of domestic violence. She wasn't the victim, yet claimed Harris was allegedly struck by the singer. The Neighborhood Talk shared the woman's posts, but they hid her name. "Man I do not care what nobody says chris brown is a woman beater," the person wrote. "When I when I vacation with them in tulum he beat ammika's rib cages in to the point where she had to call in a doctor to make sure nothing was broken."</p><span><h2 id=h-anonymous-allegations-about-ammika-harris>Anonymous Allegations About Ammika Harris</h2></span><p>The woman didn't provide a timeline or explain her relationship with the couple. The public assumed she was friends with Harris, but that wasn't clarified. Additionally, she also shared a DM exchange said to be with Brown. In it, it looks like the hitmaker sent two photos to her and then wrote, "U must be broke looking for attention." She told him to "gtfo out my dms" and "ain't nobody broke my n*gga. And you know damn well you beat that b*tch up." Brown replied with a crying laughing emoji. He added, "Whatever u say shawty."</p><p>The woman was unmoved and said, "Please don't come for me cus I humble n*ggas. Now go give your b*tch a perc cus she hurt." After sharing the screenshot, she wrote over the image, "Somebody find this man karrueche so he'll stfu." She was, of course, referencing Brown's ex-girlfriend,<a href=# rel> Karrueche Tran</a>. The actress also accused the singer of domestic violence and was given a restraining order again him.</p><span><h2>Staying Silent</h2></span><p>Aside from this exchange, there hasn't been development on these allegations. Brown hasn't addressed the controversy. His past has been a hot topic throughout his career, especially after it was learned the American Music Awards canceled his performance. Some believe his violent altercation with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Rihanna</a> all those years ago continues to haunt him. According to Brown, he'll go where he's loved and isn't worried about people who don't allow him to grow.
