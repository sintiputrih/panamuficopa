After announcing their engagement — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and soon after, their wedding</a> — in early 2023, the duo announced their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">impending divorce in mid-November</a>. The culprit behind their split could be any number of things, from their quick engagement to their age gap, and anything in between.</p><p data-characters=624 data-current-count=1022 data-injectable=true>Regardless of the “why” behind their divorce, Appleton and Gage will both be single in a matter of months, at most. With such a short marriage, its entirely possible the pair will be officially unwed within a few weeks, particularly with the kind of financial weight they can throw around. Both Appleton and Gage are worth a fair bit of cash, and everyone knows money talks. It’s likely to make the process itself a fair bit easier, but the wealthier half of the couple could be eyeing down a serious impact on their finances. Divorce is expensive, after all, particularly when you’re worth millions.</p><h2 id=h-lukas-gage-s-2023-net-worth-explained data-injectable=false>Lukas Gage’s 2023 net worth, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lukas-Gage-net-worth.jpg><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>There’s a 12-year age gap between Gage and Appleton, so its fair to assume that Appleton makes a bit more money than his younger former spouse. That’s not actually the case, however, based on an examination of each man’s net worth.</p><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>Estimates place both Appleton and Gage’s net worths in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">same general range</a>. Appleton’s bank account is likely resting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhere between $2 and $5 million</a>, according to various sources, and Gage is credited with a similar number. His earning potential most certainly outpaces Appleton’s — thanks to his involvement in several major projects, including White Lotus and Euphoria — but, as of now, he’s likewise sitting pretty on a net worth <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">between $2</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$5 million</a>.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>That should see both halves of the short-lived marriage walk away with their assets relatively intact, since neither vastly out-earns the other. That, paired with the prenuptial agreement they both signed, should lessen the financial burden of divorce. That’s one small boon in a bad situation, and might just help the process pass nice and smooth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZyquKK%2FjKCYoJ2jYrumwIywpqusmGK2r3mRaWlsZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
