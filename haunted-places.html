The paranormal activity that abounds in this house is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">credited to the legend</a> of Annie Palmer, a.k.a. the White Witch.</p><p>Annie Palmer was a voodoo practitioner who arrived in 1820. During her time there, she brutally killed her three husbands, various lovers, and slaves.</p><p>According to legend, Palmer moved to Jamaica in the early 1800s in search of a wealthy husband. She locked down the owner of the Rose Hall Estate, John Palmer, and not long after the pair had married, she poisoned him.</p><p>She repeated this pattern of marrying and killing her husbands twice more. Palmer also ruled over the plantation savagely, torturing, beating, and killing anyone on the property who went against her.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-350891 alt="Tomb Of White Witch" width=800 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tomb-of-white-witch.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-350891 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A tomb that is alleged to be the final resting place of Annie Palmer.</span></p><p>Eventually, Palmer was murdered in her sleep by one of her enslaved lovers, Takoo, after she killed one of his family members. Takoo was a voodoo practitioner as well and performed a ritual to keep Palmer in her grave, apparently fearing an attack from her even after her death.</p><p>However, the ritual was never completed and the rumors say that her spirit still roams the home’s grounds to this very day.</p><p>Her ghost has been captured in various tourist photos over the years. But even those who don’t see her claim to feel her presence. Other ghostly manifestations in the house include hurried footsteps, whispers in the dungeon, faces in the mirror, babies crying, and tapping on the walls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyprdSnq56cXaW5oq%2FErGZs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
