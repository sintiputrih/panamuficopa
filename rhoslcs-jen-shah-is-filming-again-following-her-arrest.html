Now, these defendants face time in prison for their alleged crimes.”</p><p>After Shah’s arrest, a second source told Us that her <a href=#>cast members were “completely shocked”</a> when she was taken away during filming. “The women were all about the take a trip to Colorado in the coming days. The women aren’t sure if they are still going yet,” the source added.</p><p>Earlier this month, a third insider revealed&nbsp;that Bravo wants to broadcast <a href=#>as much footage from Shah’s arrest as possible</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/RHOSLCs-Jen-Shah-Is-Filming-Again-Following-Her-Arrest-002.jpg><p>“Production sees this as a great story line. One that everyone will want to see unfold,” the third source said. “It’s ratings gold. They’re going to use as much footage as they can that they’re legally allowed to use.”</p><p>Shah isn’t shying away from discussing her legal troubles and has been vocal about the situation on social media. On Tuesday, she <a href=#>posted a quote via her Instagram Story</a> that read, “True friends will be by your side through it all,” adding the hashtags “#ShahSquad #ShahStrong #JusticeForJenShah.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The second season of RHOSLC&nbsp;does not yet have a release date, so fans will have to wait to see exactly how the Salt Lake City housewives reacted to the news.</p><p>Still, Shah’s on and off best friend, <a href=#><strong>Heather Gay</strong></a>, seemingly had something to say after the arrest.</p><p>“I AM SHOOKETH,” the Beauty Lab and Laser owner, 46, wrote in a direct message to writer&nbsp;<strong>Evan Ross Katz</strong>, who shared a&nbsp;screenshot&nbsp;of the DM on April 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp6OhsLR5yZ6lZquYlrVutdJmnaKknZ67qHnAoJiipl2bvK24zrCgp59dnbKzecCrqZ6rpGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
