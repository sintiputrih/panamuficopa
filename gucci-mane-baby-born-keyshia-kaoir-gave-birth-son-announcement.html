The married couple of three years welcomed a baby boy named <strong>Ice Davis </strong>on Dec. 23, which Gucci, 40, revealed in ecstatic Twitter and Instagram announcements. “My wife just gave me a 7lb 1oz baby boy named ICE DAVIS thank u,” the rapper gushed in his baby announcement, adding, “he is here!!!!!!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Gucci-Mane-Keyshia-KaOir-have-baby-ig-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The birth announcement also included a gorgeous <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>maternity photo</a> of Keyshia, which showed the 35-year-old entrepreneur and model cradling her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baby bump</a> while dressed in an ethereal, sheer white lace robe. Keyshia was sitting in a majestic flower wreath above a romantic pond, complete with a swan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Gucci-Mane-Keyshia-KaOir-have-baby-ig-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Keyshia shared another beautiful <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>picture</a> from the same photo shoot, and confirmed the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baby’s arrival</a> as well. “He’s here!!!!!!!!!! ICE DAVIS,” Keyshia wrote under the baby bump photo, adding that he weighs seven pounds and is “soooooo darn CUTE & PERFECT.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Gucci-Mane-Keyshia-KaOir-have-baby-ap-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>This is Gucci’s second child; his 12-year-old son <strong>Keitheon</strong>, whom the hip-hop artist shares with ex <strong>Sheena Evans</strong>, now has a little brother. Keyshia is also giving her own children another sibling: the KA’OIR Fitness CEO has two daughters and a son from a past relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It was only four months ago when Keyshia and Gucci revealed that they were happily expecting their first child together. Keyshia got cheeky with her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pregnancy announcement</a> in August, writing, “I ain’t athletic but on @gucci1017 D I did gymnastics.” Meanwhile, Gucci tweeted, “My beautiful wife pregnant life is good.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>After the big news was revealed, Keyshia used the next few months to share gorgeous baby bump photos and keep fans updated on her pregnancy journey. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>expecting mother</a> then threw a gender-reveal party with Gucci at the beginning of November, with a lavish, iced-out theme: no doubt a hint at their future baby’s name!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Keyshia met Gucci on the set of his music video for&nbsp;911 Emergency, which was released in 2010. “He was in love with me on sight,” Keyshia revealed in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fader</a>. According to Keyshia, Gucci — who had been in prison before the music video was filmed — had requested the model to be in his music video after seeing her in an issue of XXL (Keyshia was the magazine’s “Eye Candy of the Year” at the time). Gucci proposed to Keyshia in 2016, and they tied the knot in Oct. 2017.
