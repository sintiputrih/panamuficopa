According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Gentile’s net worth is as high as $500,000, an amount earned through his successful career in acting.</p><h3>Troy Gentile Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Troy Gentile was born to Debbie Gentile, with whom he moved from Florida to California at the age of four. There he finished high school, and then attended a community college, which he put on hold in order to pursue acting full-time. Before embarking on an acting career, he had a short stint on the CBS talk show “The Late Late Show with <a href=#>Craig Ferguson</a>”, where he played the young Ferguson in one episode.</p><p>Beginning at the age of twelve, Troy nabbed a steady stream of film and television roles over the course of his teens. He is predominantly a comedic actor, which was evident from his debut role when he played Matthew Hopper in the sports comedy film “Bad News Bears” (2005), alongside <a href=#>Billy Bob Thornton</a>, <a href=#>Greg Kinnear</a>, and <a href=#>Marcia Gay Harden</a>. However, it was 2006 that really put him on the map of emerging stars. First, he guest-starred in an episode of the Disney sitcom “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody” (2006), followed by two film roles, in both of which he portrayed the younger version of Jack Black’s character. He played young Ignacio, called “Nacho” in “Nacho Libre” (2006), another sports comedy, and later he played Young JB in the musical fantasy comedy film “Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny” (2006). Besides Jack Black, the latter movie also starred a plethora of famous rock and metal musicians, including <a href=#>Dave Grohl</a> and <a href=#>Ronnie James Dio</a>. His net worth was established already!</p><p>Next, Troy joined the cast of the TV comedy “Zip” (2007) as Nelson, a role he later reprised in the sequel, called “Fugly” (2007). In the meantime, he once again portrayed the younger version of the main character, this time as Young Stu (Dance Cook) in the romantic comedy “Good Luck Chuck” (2007), which also featured <a href=#>Jessica Alba</a> and <a href=#>Dan Fogler</a>. Troy continued to demonstrate his comedic abilities in “Drillbit Taylor” (2008), in which he starred alongside <a href=#>Owen Wilson</a>, followed by the family comedy “Hotel for Dogs” (2009), with a cast including <a href=#>Emma Roberts</a>, <a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a>, <a href=#>Kevin Dillon</a> and <a href=#>Don Cheadle</a>. He also found the time to guest-star in an episode of the hit comedy drama “Entourage” (2008), as well as in the medical drama “Hawthorne” (2010), stepping away for a moment from the usual comedy roles.</p><p>However, Troy’s most notable role to date remains in realm of comedy, as he has been playing Barry Goldberg, the middle child in the family sitcom “The Goldbergs” (2013-2017) for four years, which has increased his net worth significantly.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, little is known about Troy’s life away from the entertainment industry, as he tends to keep it private.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.158333333333><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Troy Gentile</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 27, 1993</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Boca Raton, Florida, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.72 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Soundtrack</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Community college</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Albert Farshi, Debbie Gentile</td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/realtroygentile</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1795630/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film - Supporting Young Actor</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Movies</td><td>Hotel for Dogs, Drillbit Taylor, 9 Lives of Mara, Good Luck Chuck, I Could Never Be Your Woman, Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, Nacho Libre, Bad News Bears</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Goldbergs, Zip</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=5.1776061776062><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=10.3359375><td>1</td><td>[observation, 2014] I'm trying to establish myself as a young adult now.
