After marrying childhood sweetheart <a href=#>Cherry Seaborn</a> in late 2018, the pair announced in August 2020 that they had welcomed their first daughter together: Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran.</p><p>Ed and Cherry welcomed a second daughter, Jupiter, in May 2022.

He showed off a photo of tiny baby socks and wrote, "Ello! A quick message from me as I have some personal news that I wanted to share with you ... Last week, with the help of an amazing delivery team, Cherry gave birth to our beautiful and healthy daughter — Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran."</p><p>He added, "We are completely in love with her. Both mum and baby are doing amazing and we are on cloud nine over here. We hope that you can respect our privacy at this time. Lots of love and I’ll see you when it’s time to come back." Lyra shares her name with the feisty protagonist of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials book series, and Antarctica comes from the continent Ed and Cherry visited pre-pregnancy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos)</a></p></figure><p>On May 19, 2022, Ed shocked the world by announcing the arrival of a second daughter! In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another Instagram post</a> featuring adorably tiny baby socks, he wrote briefly, "Want to let you all know we’ve had another beautiful baby girl. We are both so in love with her, and over the moon to be a family of four."</p><p>It wasn't until March 2023 that Ed shared her name — Jupiter — with the public. In a cover story for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Ed shared some scary details about <a href=#>his wife Cherry's cancer diagnosis</a> and how that coincided with Jupiter's birth.</p><p>While it's not clear if Cherry is in remission, an inside source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The U.S. Sun,</a> "The tumour came as a huge shock, and the fact they couldn’t operate straight away was hugely concerning and scary. But after Jupiter arrived safely, Cherry has now received the treatment needed and is recovering well. They both hope it will be a much better 2023.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ed Sheeran loves giving his children unique names.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a> in 2021, Ed confirmed that Lyra was named for the His Dark Materials protagonist and that her middle name, Antarctica, comes from the chilly continent where he and Cherry vacationed before she was pregnant.
