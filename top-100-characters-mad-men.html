Whether it was Dick’s cathouse misadventures, or the show trying to pass off 37-year-old Jon Hamm as a fresh-faced military recruit, the flashbacks proved there was a limit to our interest in explaining Don Draper. Therefore, pre-Don, and by extension, most of the rest of the Whitman clan, have the honor of officially being The Worst.

He mostly just told Lane what to do from across the pond, and conspired to have the Sterling Cooper-enhanced PPL sold to McCann Erikson. He also stands out because of the peculiar way Lane would pronounce his name (Sin-jin? Sen-jin?
