"All cheating rumors are false. Both are currently single."&nbsp;</p><p id=e9kPvL13iTn data-wc=34>Billie echoed this sentiment on her Instagram Stories that August when a fan asked about her relationship with Jesse. “Very very good friends only,” she wrote of The Neighbourhood frontman, adding, "My homie forever."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1d91a16a2db2-gettyimages-1205131654.jpg><p id=evZUYTcY7lr data-wc=25>Billie and Jesse were first romantically linked on October 13, 2022, when they were spotted together at Crossroads Kitchen, a vegan restaurant in West Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><p id=eT3Hj76gEZW data-wc=31>Their romance became Instagram official on November 1, 2022, when Billie posted a series of photos of their Halloween costumes with the caption, "Life is craaaaaaaaaaaaaaazy," complete with a clown emoji.</p><p id=eBhyXIm1255 data-wc=31>The couple attended several high-profile events together before their breakup, including the 2023 Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty and the 2022 LACMA Art + Film Gala, where they made their public debut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0650a0f2521f-billie-eilish-academy-gala.jpg><p id=euQI4Zmpey1 data-wc=26>Since their split, Billie has been more open about her personal life, including her journey with her sexuality, a topic she initially intended to keep private.&nbsp;</p><p id=eoriTOAN_hG data-wc=80>Reflecting on her coming out, which made headlines after her Variety interview in December, Billie told Rolling Stone, “The whole world suddenly decided who I was, and I didn’t get to say anything or control any of it. Nobody should be pressured into being one thing or the other … It takes a while to find yourself, and I think it’s really unfair, the way that the internet bullies you into talking about who you are and what you are.”</p><p id=e5liQwzKTod data-wc=21>Her latest album features the explicit track Lunch, which Billie says played a crucial role in her journey of self-discovery. “</p><p id=ez6NBvdJKDf data-wc=57>That song was actually part of what helped me become who I am, to be real,” the Oscar winner shared. “I wrote some of it before even doing anything with a girl, and then wrote the rest after.” She added, “I’ve been in love with girls for my whole life, but I just didn’t understand—until, last year.”</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
