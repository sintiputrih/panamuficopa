In fact, at one point during <a href=# rel=noopener>the Emmy winners’ conversation</a>, LeBlanc noted that even just as actors, “our job is to…&nbsp;be so honest about mental health, about sexual preference, about the things you don’t hear in history books… ”</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Young & Restless fan fave returns</a></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>So after joking about their first meeting (watching Daytime Emmy Outstanding Lead Actress reels that left Benard banging his head against the wall)&nbsp;and comparing their ages (“I’m 63, so you’re a tiny tyke to me,” LeBlanc cracked), they got serious. Like, deadly serious.</p><p>LeBlanc discussed his brother, who succumbed to AIDS at just 25 years old, and lamented the fact that “in the regular rhythm of education, we are not exposed to so many things that are the main force driving some people. So, therefore, we are pretty much in a bubble with the people who are driven by the same things.”</p><p>What that can lead to is… if you are different, if your feelings don’t conform… “then you think that you are just the bizarre one,” LeBlanc said. Hell, “not till after Stonewall did anyone take a gay man serious. [The general consensus was that] they were sick people.</p><p>“I still live with the legacy of that as a gay man,” he added. The ramifications of that? “I still don’t hold my husband’s hand of 28 years in public. Can’t do it.”</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Photo album celebrating Jess Walton’s Jill-iversary</a></p><p>In part, that’s because LeBlanc and his significant other are “not big PDA people. But part of it is like… ”</p><p>Yeah, we get it. Sadly, maybe. But we do.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/yr-christian-jules-leblanc-michael-hw.jpg alt="Christian LeBlanc yr michael hw" width=650 height=379 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>What do you think?
