In the snaps, Courtad, 30, has his arms around Lewis, 25, as they smiled during a hangout in Cleveland, Ohio.</p><p>“Babeee we need confirmation yes or no,” social media star <strong>Zachary Reality</strong> commented on the post. Previously, Zachary — whose real name is Zachary Weinberg — posted a TikTok video speculating if Courtad and Lewis were friends or something more.</p><p>“I did not see this coming… maybe just friends?” he <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned the video</a> posted earlier this month, which included other photos from the shoot, which Courtad posted on December 22.</p><p>“We had fun in Cleveland cant ya tell 🎄,” he <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned the photos</a>. “And there’s always going to be an impromptu photoshoot when @samcjeffries is around. Thanks for capturing a few good happy moments 📸 What do you think me and @itslivlew were cracking up about 🤔.”</p><p>Former Bachelor Nation members <strong>Ashley Iaconetti</strong> and <strong>Ben Higgins</strong> also weighed in on the possible couple.</p><p>“It’s one of those weird borderline things. It could definitely be friendship and it could definitely be them together,” Iaconetti, 35, stated on the Wednesday, December 27, episode of their <a href=# rel=noopener>“Almost Famous” podcast</a>. “It’s not happening, that’s my thought.”</p><p>Higgins, 34, said he “only” has one comment on the two “very attractive people.” He said that “something could be sparked” because they’re both good looking, explaining that he doesn’t know a lot of adult men with platonic female friends.</p><p>“Maybe Bachelor Nation’s different,” he added. “Or maybe, I’m wrong.”</p><p>Courtad and Lewis both headed to the beach for Bachelor in Paradise season 9, which aired its season finale earlier this month. The duo didn’t find a romantic connection together on the beach, both leaving the show single. (Courtad is from <strong>Charity Lawson</strong>’s <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> season while Lewis made her debut during <strong>Zach Shallcross</strong>’ <a href=#>Bachelor</a> season.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lewis had some pretty complicated romances during BiP, as she was <a href=#>in a love triangle</a> with <strong>Kat Izzo</strong> and <strong>John Henry Spurlock</strong> for a few episodes. While Spurlock, 31, ended up picking Izzo, 27, whom he got engaged to before <a href=#>their post-season split</a>, Lewis moved on with <strong>Michael Barbour</strong>. However, Barbour, 28, ultimately broke things off.</p><p>Courtad also didn’t have much love in the luck department. While he hit things off with Izzo, <strong>Rachel Recchia</strong> and <strong>Jess Girod</strong>, he didn’t find a long-lasting love with any of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaboaCoerC4yK%2BgmmWcmsSqv4yapZ1lpJa7r7HRZpqoraKprqV5wqixsmWlpXqnu9Fmp6GnpKR6tLTOqKto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
