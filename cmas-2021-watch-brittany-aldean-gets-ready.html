It doesn’t happen very often,” Brittany told Us.&nbsp; “But to be honest, we like to to order food, sit at home, catch up on shows.

Our life is pretty chaotic, being able to just be home is really nice.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Jason also previously opened up to <i>Us Weekly </i>about balancing work with his family life.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Brittany-Aldean-Gets-Ready-Country-Music-Awards-0001.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s1>“Now I’ve made it a point at this point of my career to scale back a little bit and still make sure that I’m out playing shows and doing what I need to do there, but spending a little more time at home too,” the Tennessee native told <i>Us</i> in January 2020. “I think it’s something that I’ve gotten a grip on a little, the older I’ve gotten and the longer I’ve been in the business. I think I’ve finally, after all these years, got it figured out now.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Check out Jason’s <a href=#>latest album, Macon,</a> and find him on Walmart and Sam’s Club radio this weekend sharing some of his favorite songs and the stories behind his new music.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Country Music Awards, which will be hosted by <a href=#><strong>Luke Bryan</strong></a>, will broadcast live on ABC from the Bridgestone Arena Wednesday, November 10 at 8 p.m. ET.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5i6or%2BMa2draV2srrWvx2aZq6Gkqa6vxYyao52dkaN6qLHTrGSrnZGZxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
