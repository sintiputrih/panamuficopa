The eight-part series will then run every consecutive Thursday, with the season finale airing on 27 February. We can't wait to find out what happens in St. Marie next!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/92477d8d9315-death-paradise-z.jpg><h2>What is the plot of Death in Paradise season nine?</h2><p id=e9sCtvGr9HJa data-wc=79>BBC has released the synopsis for the first episode, where it appears that St. Marie continues to be a hot spot for murder! The synopsis reads: "New Yearâ€™s Eve celebrations are cut short when a masked man stabs a woman in her own home. Jack and the team must uncover the identity of the mystery murderer before they strike again." The trailer also teases plenty of romance on the island, which enjoys Jack enjoying cocktails with a new character.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9c68d27df258-death-paradise-5-z.jpg><h2>Is there a trailer for Death in Paradise season nine?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eRLeeSwmyD52 data-wc=23>The trailer was released on New Year's Day, and shows a glimpse of the new detective on the island - watch it here:&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">Death in Paradise Series 9: Trailer | BBC Trailers</a><h2>Who is in the cast of Death in Paradise season nine?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eAqw9HhYfvap data-wc=85>Ardal will be in the first half of the season before gracefully bowing out, with Ralf Little taking over as the new detective for the latter half.

Since you can't fly there from the UK, keen fans of the show would have to journey to France ahead of their holiday. The show's executive producer recently opened up about why they chose to film there, telling HELLO! and other reporters: "</p><p id=eEfmTEWjmO2R data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Death in Paradise star Ardal O'Hanlon reveals real reason he's leaving the show</a></strong></p><p id=eUpDtucm9VQ1 data-wc=85>It looks beautiful but also it's not overdeveloped, it's not a very modern Caribbean island, nor is it less developed - it's just right for us. It is it's own little place because one side is very flat and more developed and we're on the less flat, harder to get around side, but it's a stunning place.
