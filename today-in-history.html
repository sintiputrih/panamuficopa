He’d been arrested and dethroned several months prior, but in the midst of the French Revolution, the public was still demanding that he be brought to justice after it was discovered that he was colluding with foreign powers to overthrow the revolutionary government. The trial lasted until Jan. 15, 1793, when he was unanimously found guilty. He was publicly executed via guillotine six days later.</p><h2>1936: King Edward VIII Abdicates The Throne</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>King Edward VIII</a> abdicates the English throne to marry Wallis Simpson. On January 20, 1936, Edward VIII took the throne. Months into his reign, Edward expressed his desire to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American woman. The relationship was highly controversial in the United Kingdom and caused a constitutional crisis. Edward decided to abdicate the throne to marry Simpson, resulting in one of the shortest reigns in British history.</p><h2>1963: Frank Sinatra Jr. Is Found Safe After Kidnapping</h2><p>A few days after Frank Sinatra Jr. was kidnapped, the son of “Ol’ Blue Eyes” is found safe in Los Angeles.

Bertha Franklin, the manager of the motel, claimed she shot him in self-defense after he threatened her life and tried to rape the young woman he’d checked in with.</p><p>The courts eventually ruled the 33-year-old’s death a justifiable homicide, but his family and supporters are adamant that there is more to the story and that foul play was involved. As Muhammad Ali once said, “If Cooke had been Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, or Ricky Nelson, the FBI would be investigating.”</p><h2>1978: The Lufthansa Heist Takes Place</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-394825 alt="Lufthansa Heist" width=900 height=562 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lufthansa-heist-aftermath.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-394825 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Nick Sorrentino/NY Daily News via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>A Lufthansa employee shows FBI agents where he and others were tied up during the robbery.</span></p><p>Six thieves steal $5 million in cash and an additional $875,000 in jewelry from John F.
