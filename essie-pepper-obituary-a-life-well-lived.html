Born to Lancaster and Elsie Roe Meredith, Essie was a cherished member of the community, known for her warmth, kindness, and love for life. Essie’s journey was marked by the joys of being a dedicated homemaker, finding fulfillment in creating a loving and nurturing environment for her family.</p><p>Her passing leaves a void in the hearts of those who knew her, but her legacy of love and care will forever endure. Preceding her in death were her parents, Lancaster and Elsie, along with her siblings. Essie also faced the heartache of losing two daughters, Diane Pepper Begnoche and Patricia Pepper Arndt, as well as her beloved husband, George Pepper. Essie is survived by her grandson, Christopher Begnoche of Utah, who undoubtedly carries on her spirit of love and resilience. In addition, she leaves behind a circle of special friends who provided comfort and companionship in her later years – Arlena Coker, Stacy and Raul Montanez, and Mary Sanders.</p><p>Friends and well-wishers are invited to pay their respects at the memorial service on Tuesday, December 26, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. The service will be held at Pippin Funeral Home, located at 119 W. Camden-Wyoming Avenue, Wyoming. Gatherings will begin one hour earlier, allowing friends to share memories and console one another as they celebrate the remarkable life of Essie Louise Pepper. In honoring her memory, Dover comes together to commemorate a life well-lived and bid farewell to a cherished member of the community.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaJ2jqLamec%2Bep6mdomK8o7XTrpirsV2Weq21xZ5ksJ2coXqttdWem2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
