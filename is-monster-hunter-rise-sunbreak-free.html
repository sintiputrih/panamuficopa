Players take on the role of Hunters as they slay all sorts of creatures ranging from small to impossibly enormous. Working either solo or in an online group, players can defeat monsters and craft items and weapons to take on even bigger foes as the game progresses.</p><p>The game was immensely popular on release, becoming the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">second best-selling title</a> in the series behind Monster Hunter World.</p><p>In its first DLC expansion, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunbreak</a> seeks to make the world of Rise even bigger. Hunters begin a new quest in the land of Elgado, an outpost threatened by an elder dragon named Malzeno. Players will be able to take on a new difficulty level in the form of Master Rank quests. New monsters, new characters, and updated gameplay tweaks will be included in this exciting update — and with new monsters comes new armor for your Hunter to become even stronger. With an update this big, is the DLC free?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As a self-proclaimed "Massive Expansion" to Monster Hunter Rise, Sunbreak will most certainly cost money to play. The DLC itself starts at $40 to pre-order and download upon release. You'll also need to have the base game already downloaded to have access to the DLC. Players will also have to have completed the "Serpent Goddess of Thunder" quest in the main game to start the DLC campaign.</p><p>What's more, there are a variety of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">different ways</a> to purchase the DLC.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Of course, the DLC can be bought on its own through the Nintendo eShop for players who already have Rise. You can even digitally purchase a "Deluxe Edition" that includes different armor sets and cosmetics right out of the gate. For new players, you'll also be able to purchase the base game and Sunbreak as one bundle for $70.</p><p>No matter which version of the DLC you decide to get, Sunbreak will undoubtedly feature plenty of content to make it worth your while. The paid DLC expansion adds so much to an already-enormous game that it almost feels like an entirely new title.</p><p>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak will be released for both Nintendo Switch and PC on June 30.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuuc6nqq2domK1trrTnqlmqpmosm6%2F1KeZq52RoHqnvsSe</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
