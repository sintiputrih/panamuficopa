At this point, y’all can keep the throwaways and leaks. I’ll be starting ‘Lana’ from scratch. Do not ask me about it again. Thank you.” She added in a follow-up: “I’ll round up the leaks y’all already got and u can have those. Seems like a fair deal. ENJOY.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sza-performs-at-the-grammy-awards>SZA Performs At The Grammy Awards</h2></span><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 04: (FOR EDITORIAL USE ONLY) SZA performs during the 66th GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 04, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

Back in January, she threatened to take legal action over the situation. “Leaking my music is stealing,” she wrote at the time. “This is my job. This is my life and my intellectual property. You are a f*cking thief, and I promise to put maximum energy into holding everyone accountable to the full extent of the law. I am tired.” Check out her posts on the matter on Twitter below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sza-expresses-frustration-over-leaked-songs>SZA Expresses Frustration Over Leaked Songs</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">SZA has been working on the deluxe version of her critically acclaimed 2022 album for over a year now. Speaking with Variety in December, she admitted the work she's put into it is starting to make it feel like it's own separate album. She dropped the lead single, "Saturn," last month. There's still no release date for Lana.
