As a matter of fact, he was her first baby and born when January was 33 years old.</p><p>January Jones is one of the elite actresses in Hollywood. Mostly, she is famous for her role as Betty Draper in ‘Mad Men’.</p><p>Moreover, she came into the limelight after her lead role in ‘The Last Man on Earth’, a comedy-drama series.</p><p>Despite all the news surrounding her son, she is one of the many celebrities who are yet to disclose her baby father’s identity.</p><p>So, let’s explore the facts on Xander Dane Jones’s birth, family, and baby daddy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=xander-dane-jones-celebrates-his-birthday-on-september-13-8-years-of-age></span>Xander Dane Jones celebrates his Birthday on September 13- 8 Years of Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The birth of a celebrity child is bound to make the headlines. Similarly, Xander Dane Jones also made one in 2011.</p><p>He was born in 2011. In fact, Jones celebrates his birthday on September 13 every year.</p><p>Xander Dane Jones’s age is&nbsp;<strong>8 years old as of 2020.</strong></p><p>Despite grabbing the spotlight right from the hospital bed, January has somehow managed to keep her son out of the headlines as far as possible.</p><p>Born at St. John’s Medical Center in Santa Monica, LA, January ate a capsule that had her own placenta&nbsp;according to sources.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=xander-dane-jones-only-has-a-matriarchal-part-of-the-family></span>Xander Dane Jones only has a Matriarchal part of the Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>January Jones has strictly kept her son around her family. For that matter, she has not introduced the baby daddy to the world.</p><p>With that, the patriarchal part of Xander’s family is out of the picture. As a result, Xander Dane Jones only has a mother as a direct family.</p><p>However, January’s family is always by his side. That includes his grandfather&nbsp;<strong>Marvin Jones&nbsp;</strong>and grandmother&nbsp;<strong>Karen Cox.&nbsp;</strong>Marvin is an exercise physiologist and Karen is a store manager.</p><p>On top of that, Xander Dane Jones also has 2 lovely aunts, Jacey and Jina. That basically concludes Xander’s matriarchal part of the family and all in all, a family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=xander-dane-jones-mother-january-jones></span>Xander Dane Jones Mother January Jones<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>January Jones is not a new name for Hollywood fans. As a matter of fact, she is an actress and model voted 16th in the list of ‘World’s Sexiest Women’.</p><p>That concludes the fame of Xander’s mother January Jones. She has an&nbsp;IMDb profile&nbsp;with 32 acting credits. The list includes some big names like ‘Mad Men’, ‘The Last Man on Earth’, ‘The Politician’, ‘Law & Order’, ‘Huff’, and many more.</p><p>January was shooting the fifth season of ‘Mad Men’ during her pregnancy. After 2 months of Xander’s birth, she came back to shoot for the remainder of the season.</p><p>As a yoga freak, she loves exercises and workouts.

For instance, January has kept some deep secrets about her baby Xander’s daddy.</p><p>Just like some of the famous names these days, she has not revealed his identity yet. This is kind of a trend mostly among the rappers. However, January, herself is kind of a secretive person.</p><p>The best thing is that there are&nbsp;some rumors&nbsp;about who the daddy could be but none of them clearly make a point. Actually, January has always kept her personal and dating life out of the public eye.</p><p>As a result, her fans and followers can’t even throw dice to guess some names of Xander’s daddy so far.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaLCRo7GmvoydmKedXZ%2B8r7HSZpmiqqSdsaLFjJqenmWWlrqquNhmoZqmpZa%2FunnJqKWeq12XrqPFjJ2YnZypZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
