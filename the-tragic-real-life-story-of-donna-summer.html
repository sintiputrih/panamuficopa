According to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, no one knew she had cancer except her immediate family and few close friends. Some said she wanted to keep it hidden, so she lived as a recluse the year before. Chemotherapy made her lose a lot of weight, and if anybody saw her it would be obvious she was sick.</p><p dir=ltr>In the <a href=#>LA Times</a>, Rachel Schwartz from the Lung Cancer Foundation of America said it was typical for people with lung cancer to shy away from telling others because of the stigma of smoking. <a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;reported that her family wanted to make it clear her cancer was not due to smoking. While alive, Summer told people it was caused by the asbestos in the air from the fall of the twin towers on 9-11.</p><p dir=ltr>Instead of taking Summer and her family at their word, many have openly debated whether or not she got cancer from asbestos or smoking. According to <a href=#>Amo Mamma</a>, it was even in an episode of "Autopsy: The Last Hours of...," a show where the cause of death is explored. The host, Dr. Michael Hunter, stated while it is likely she was exposed to debris following the terrorist attack, it was not likely she would have gotten cancer from it. Many believe it was from smoking when she was younger and singing in smoke filled clubs. Also, lung cancer ran in her family, killing both her mother and younger sister.</p><p dir=ltr>Summer left behind three daughters and her husband of thirty-two years, Bruce Sudano.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Fj2ttcmpfqbWmedOrmKChk2K%2Fpq3LZqOinpViwLW70bJkqJ5dmbyvusBmqq6lnZq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
