She clearly takes joy in capturing the candid moments that we see every day as part of our family life, but that rarely gets captured by professional photographers. Among El Paso family photographers, she is known for her kind and caring approach. Her modus operandi is to take care of the families she photographs as though they are members of her own extended family. You won’t find a kinder, more talented photographer no matter where you look.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Chrisinda has a passion for photography and strives to turn every family she photographs into a work of art. She’s well-known in the area, not just for her family photography, but for her wedding photography and portraits as well. Chrisinda has owned her photography business since 2006, and in 2015, became El Paso’s very first Certified Professional Photographer. In other words, she knows her stuff, from an educational and experiential standpoint.</p><p>She shoots both in-studio and on location, capturing the personalities of the individuals that make up your family, as well as that special something that happens when you and your family all get together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Amanda takes bright, light-filled photographs of couples, families, and individuals. Her photos are traditional yet stylish, perfect for sharing on Instagram or for hanging over your mantel. We love her laughter-filled narrative photos, which show El Paso families at their best, leaning into each other’s comforting love. If your family works with Amanda, you’re guaranteed to get shot after shot of you and your family exactly the way you’ll want to remember yourselves — and, perhaps more importantly, the way you want to be remembered.</p><p>We also adore how Amanda describes her passion for shooting family photographs. “Anyone can pick up a camera. But I truly believe the best photos come when the person behind the lens is working to let your soul shine through in your photos — I want to give you pictures that will bring you back to the time in your life when they were taken.” Sounds wonderful to us.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Jeanette Fryer is a skilled composer of memories. Her photographs are natural and joy-filled — capturing something hard to explain about the passing of youth, as well as the joys and sweet pains of parenthood. Her in-studio work especially shines, hearkening back to earlier and more traditional days of family photographs, while capturing all the attention to color, careful contrast, and balance that are the hallmark of contemporary photos.</p><p>If you want photos like the ones your parents once took with you and your siblings — but with a modern twist — Jeanette’s among the best El Paso family photographers that we’ve come across.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Sonia is a renowned and extremely well-respected newborn photographer, in addition to an excellent portrait and family photographer. In her newborn work, she’s honed her composition skills to the level of a master — putting color, light, and shadow to work to create pure, angelic photographs that are so lovingly composed it’s hard to stop scrolling through her Instagram feed.</p><p>She’s a patient, humble, and hugely skilled photographer, able to wait for and work for the perfect shot without ever diminishing the fun she’s able to create with her photoshoots. You and your kids will love working with her.</p><p>For the last decade, Liz Houser of Lightfall Photography has made it her personal mission to celebrate special moments in her clients’ lives. When you look through her portfolio, you will see plenty of smiling faces of adoring families. You will also notice how utterly vibrant her photos are, which is a nice change from the typical subdued style many photographers prefer. She also customizes family photography packages to meet your needs.</p><p>In her own words: “I want to hear your story. Not only hear it –&nbsp;I want to experience it, capture it, tell it. I am passionate about helping you preserve your legacy through fine art in a way that only a high-end, custom photographer can.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbHEq6qpmZOae6S7zGipnqufqr%2BksdJonZqlmaHGbrzHqKuon6KWvamx0axknqRdpa60u44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
