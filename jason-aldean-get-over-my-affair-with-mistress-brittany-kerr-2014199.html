And then when I finally do get enough of it and say something, every newspaper grabs it. And I’m not trying to get in the headlines — I’m just trying to get people to stop running their mouths.”</p><p>The country megastar was <a href=# rel=noopener>caught kissing</a> American Idol contestant <strong>Brittany Kerr</strong> in a Hollywood bar back in September 2012, while he was still married to his wife <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Jessica Ussery</a></strong>. (The ex spouses of 12 years <a href=# rel=noopener>share two little girls, <strong>Keeley</strong>, 11, and <strong>Kendyl</strong>, 6</a>.) Aldean <a href=# rel=noopener>apologized for his indiscretion</a> and attempted to repair his marriage, only to file for divorce in 2013.</p><p>This past June, Kerr <a href=# rel=noopener>controversially accompanied Aldean</a> to the 2014 CMT Awards in Nashville. One month later, Aldean took to his Instagram to <a href=# rel=noopener>defend his relationship</a> with his former mistress. “So sick of people judging me and @brittanylkerr over things they know nothing about,” he wrote. “I have made mistakes but i am a better person because of it, and wouldnt change a thing. Im happier than i have ever been, so thank u to all the people who support us. We are happy and life goes on. Its time to move on people.”</p><p>Not much has changed since his public plea, as Aldean admitted to Billboard that the negative feedback still eats away at him. “I’m pretty private, but over the last couple of years I’ve gotten that taken away from me, which kind of pissed me off,” he said. “You know, my kids get on there and read all that. I’m not blaming anybody. Obviously, a lot of that stuff is my own deal. But I could go post something on my page right now that says, ‘Hey, we just donated $5 million to a children’s cancer research center,’ and somebody would get on there and go, ‘You’re an asshole cheater.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Aldean lamented, “If I want to take my daughters to the mall, that’s what we’re going to do. If me and Brit want to go on a date, I’m not going to say, ‘We need to eat dinner at the house, and sneak in the back door of the movie theater.’ That’s ridiculous.”</p><p>Despite what critics say, Aldean said he was resolutely remaining true to himself. “I hope people feel like what you see is what you get with me,” he told the mag. “I don’t try to be something I’m not. It’s too much work to try to be something else.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaOku26ty52cmqZdnLK1ec6vnKtlna56orLFmqCrZaeewal5zKKqraqVqMBurtGiq62Znq56rLHRq2RraGFpfnqFjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
