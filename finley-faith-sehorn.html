The marriage of the New York Giants star and Angie has gotten a lot of attention because of his unconventional and public proposal.

Jason proposed to her in front of a live studio audience and millions of television viewers.</p><p>The NFL player has three adult daughters with Rizzoli & Isles actress Angie Harmon. The couple’s middle child, Avery Sehorn, was born on June 22, 2005, and their third child, Emery Sehorn, was born on December 18, 2008. Harmon and Sehorn’s marriage did not work out, and they divorced. In November 2014, the pair announced their separation after thirteen years of marriage. They divorced in December 2015, although their children are shared between them. Finley and her siblings see their father and mother on a regular basis. Both have moved on with their separate life partners and are happy in their current situations. Angie announced her engagement to actor Greg Vaughan in November 2018. They were reunited in July of 2018. Jason Sehorn met Meghann Gunderman, who became a special person in his life, in a similar manner.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth>Net Worth</span></h2><p>Finley Faith is the lucky girl, which comes as no surprise.
