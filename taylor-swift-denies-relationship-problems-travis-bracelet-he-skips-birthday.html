It’s also how Travis and Taylor first connected; he tried to give her a bracelet with his phone number on it after attending her concert. Travis made the admission on his podcast, which he co-hosts with his brother Jason Kelce.</p><p>Though Travis said the attempt was unsuccessful, his podcast comments apparently caught the attention of Taylor. Within a few weeks, the couple were seen hanging out publicly, and they’ve been going strong ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reports-say-travis-is-getting-ready-to-propose-to-taylor>Reports Say Travis Is Getting Ready To Propose To Taylor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar51804042-1.jpg><p>Speaking to <a href=#>TIME Magazine</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> earlier this month</a>, Taylor revealed that their relationship didn’t start with their first public outing. Rather, they began seeing each other privately after Travis’ podcast comments caught Taylor’s attention.</p><p>“This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,” she told the outlet.</p><p>“We started hanging out right after that,” Taylor went on. “So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other. By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard-launch a first date.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, reports have suggested the pair are getting serious quickly. Not only is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor living at Travis’ $6 million Kansas mansion</a> in between tour stops and other obligations, but he’s also apparently gearing up to propose to her. One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">report claims it could happen over Christmas</a>.</p><p>Taylor broke up with Joe Alwyn after six years together at the start of 2023, amid reports that his hesitation to get married played a part. If the rumors are true, perhaps Taylor will get the engagement she wants with Travis, possibly even before the end of the year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llJq7qrHSZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWgp7yjuMSmqmasopbDqr%2BMm6mam5WhsrV5x55krKOZpcBursirq6Gcka58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
