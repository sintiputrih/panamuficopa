What pivotal sequences underwent the biggest transformations on their way from script to screen? Today, writer-director Stephen Chbosky talks about a key late scene in </i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower<i>, which he adapted from his own novel. What crucial change did he make in the editing room? He tells Kyle Buchanan (and beware, as <strong>SPOILERS</strong> follow):</i></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d1f3d24d7f0328d24399b37a88b7de84-2-0-1@published data-word-count=104>The scene that was both hardest to crack and also had the most different versions was Charlie’s breakdown. I knew I wanted to tell an emotional story, because my novel’s an emotional story, but I also knew that since film is more visceral, there would only be so much emotional heaviness that an audience could take. What I figured out early on was if I make the audience go through what Charlie is going through as much as possible, in that if Charlie blacks out, we black out, then I can talk about every emotion I want to and not burn out the audience.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d1f3d24d7f0328d24399b37a88b7de84-3-0-0@published data-word-count=81>On set, once I saw Logan Lerman delivering that performance, I realized that now I had my maypole to build my scene around. You cannot underestimate how when you write, “Charlie cries” — two words on a piece of paper — it’s not the same thing as this young man delivering this moment. I had to write new dialogue when his sister is talking to him on the phone, because my lead delivered something that was better than what I’d hoped.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d1f3d24d7f0328d24399b37a88b7de84-4-0-0@published data-word-count=157>Once I had the footage, I thought that the big aha moment would be revealing his aunt’s death — and that’s what I was writing the screenplay to build to — but once I got the film on its feet, I realized it wasn’t enough of a payoff. We’d already guessed that’s what had happened, so instead, I put it in the middle of the movie. Now I needed a new aha moment. As I was cutting the footage, I saw that Charlie as a little boy was walking in the same room that Charlie as a grown teenager was having a breakdown in. I originally had a different plan for that footage, but when I saw it played side by side, that became my aha moment. I became interested in exploring the emotional idea of a haunted house, and it became far more powerful than even the best version of the death reveal could have been.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d1f3d24d7f0328d24399b37a88b7de84-5-0-0@published data-word-count=164>I have a saying: There’s a difference between filming a script and making a movie. I was not precious about cutting things for the movie, because I already had the novel exactly the way I wanted it to be. I’ll give you another example, though it has nothing to do with this scene: I had it in my mind that after they graduated, the characters would run up this hill, and there was a hill that I’d always wanted to film. I’m talking seventeen years that I wanted to film this shot! And then we were supposed to shoot it on a Monday night, and on the Friday before, we were doing a football scene, and I turned around and saw the bleachers at sunset and thought, Wow, that is a beautiful shot. And in that moment, I changed it from the hill to the bleachers, and it became one of the best images in the film. You have to listen to your intuition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f8c/e1d/e6fdb099aadb1f7628f877c961c1c1d0f5-20-perks-of-being-a-wallflower.rsquare.w400.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8fb/e64/892382cb3b2c2e549e984de34dce956862-29-perks1.w710.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/42d/3e7/6934ca9951a4614e5bed9e328e183fc2b5-29-perks2.w710.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/196/4df/fc406e737d5f995d22d008229a45f5a964-29-perks3.w710.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fd9/7a4/25201d0c2cb5df96973f37f07d8ba7f47d-29-perks4.w710.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/bf4/462/44389958ac3bd7f987c6eb318d58f75ca8-29-perks5.w710.jpg> <span class=ambrose-short-hed>Toughest Scene: Perks of Being a Wallflower</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWloa2dhZ3y1u9Sgn56rpGLApLHNnmSpnaKgwG67xWaZnqGenHqiedaao6WenKTEpr6NoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
