The article appeared in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly column called News and Notes.</a></p><p>“They were obsessed with her weight,” the fan added. “As a fat woman who grew up obsessed with&nbsp;‘Clueless,’ who grew up obsessed with this movie that is pure camp, it just makes me very frustrated to know that … she couldn’t have been more than 130 [pounds] and they were straight-up ripping on her constantly over this.”</p><p>Silverstone nodded in agreement and quipped “I love you!” to the fan for speaking up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>“Say you’re sorry to Alicia Silverstone!” the fan demanded, directing her anger toward certain publications who shamed her way back when.</p><p>In a 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Guardian</a>, Silverstone looked&nbsp;back the bad press and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">negative reviews</a> “Batman & Robin” got when it debuted.</p><p>“They would make fun of my body when I was younger. It was hurtful, but I knew they were wrong. I wasn’t confused,” she said. “I knew that it was not right to make fun of someone’s body shape. That doesn’t seem like the right thing to be doing to a human.”</p><p>In the same ’90s EW article, a source claimed that Silverstone “lost 10 pounds, and she’s on her way to losing another 10” for the DC film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/alicia-silverstone-00.jpg><p><a href=#>Late director Schumacher </a>even noted in the same column that the Batgirl character is a “strenuous role.”</p><p>“They’re roles where the audience gets to know them a little more intimately, physically. Silverstone will wear a skintight version of the Batsuit,” the “St. Elmo’s Fire” filmmaker said at the time, adding that the suit comes ”with nipples. We’re an equal opportunity movie.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkaG2pLXAZqqipKaav7TAzqecZqqVmK6tuNJmmqutlaF6o7vDsmSsoJGitq%2BzjKilZpqRqbqiuoyrppuhnmK9s7HSrGStp6WnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
