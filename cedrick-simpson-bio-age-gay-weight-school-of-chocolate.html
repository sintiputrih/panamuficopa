Netflix dropped its yummiest series ever </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>School of Chocolate</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> on November 26, 2021, and the casts are bursting with talent. But one contestant, Cedrick Simpson has specifically caught our eye, who has remarkably lost his weight and could potentially be gay.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, what’s his story? Keep reading his Cedrick Simpson Bio to find out.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Cedrick Simpson On School Of Chocolate</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Netflix’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>School of Chocolate </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>was all about the eight pros including Cedrick Simpson who studied the art of chocolate under the tutelage of a famed chocolatier, Amaury Guichon. Throughout eight episodes, they learned tricks and skills that not only elevated their knowledge of pastry and chocolate but also gave them a life-changing experience.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But since this is a competition, only one will be named “Best in Class” and receive a $50,000 cash prize to start their own small business. Also, they’ll go on to each an international master class at Chef Amaury Guichon’s pastry academy in Las Vegas.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Cedrick, the toughest thing for him on the show was to break from his style to a completely new perspective.“Thinking outside of the box! Reflecting on it now, it all seemed so simple. I was able to trust the process and implement new techniques that were taught,” he added.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This season, Cedrick’s joined by co-contestants <a href=#>Juan Gutierrez</a>, Amanda Miller, Daniel <a href=#>Joseph Corpuz</a>, Mellisa Root, Stephanie Norcio, Thiago Silva, and Tyricia Clark. All equally talented. However, Cedrick might have a slight upper hand on a few others, as </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>School of Chocolate</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> wasn’t his first time on a reality show.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Previously, Cedrick participated in the sixth season of the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Holiday Baking Championship</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> that aired on Food Network in 2020. He was sent home over his sweet potato pie with cake mix crust, cranberry gelée, and brown sugar meringue. The judges said his meringue to be loose, the cranberries to be bland and the cake burnt.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>His IMBD profile mentioned him to have appeared on 5 episodes of&nbsp; </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Holiday Baking Championship</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, with the last being “Trendsetting Turkey Day.”</span></p><h3><b>Is Cedrick Simpson Gay?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Cedrick Simpson didn’t officially reveal it but he could potentially be gay.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>School of Chocolate</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star often was spotted attending the pride parade and even uploaded an IG video from the one in September 2017.
