Gisele, fashionâ€™s new Ã¼ber- (not super-) model. Gisele is currently shooting five massive advertising campaigns, starring on the cover of W, and playing the muse to t/bersnappers Steven Meisel and Mario Testino. In short, Gisele is huge.</p>â€”Sally Singer, New York Magazine editor (1999)<h2>Biography/Timeline</h2><span>1970</span><p>BÃ¼ndchen's $700 Taschen book released in celebration of her 20th year career sold out in one day, before hitting shelves.</p><span>1990</span><p>In the late 1990s, BÃ¼ndchen was the first in a wave of <a href=#>Brazilian</a> <a href=#>Models</a> to find international success. In 1999, <i>Vogue</i> noted "The Return of the Sexy Model", and she was credited with ending the "heroin chic" era of modeling. BÃ¼ndchen was one of the Victoria's Secret Angels from 2000 until mid-2007. BÃ¼ndchen pioneered the "horse walk", a stomping movement created when a model picks her knees up high and kicks her feet out in front. In a 2007 <i>Vogue</i> interview, Claudia Schiffer stated that BÃ¼ndchen is the only remaining supermodel.</p><span>1993</span><p>In 1993, BÃ¼ndchen joined a modeling course with her sisters PatrÃ­cia and Gabriela at their mother's insistence. The following year, BÃ¼ndchen was discovered by the Elite modeling agency at a shopping mall in SÃ£o Paulo while on a school excursion. She was subsequently selected for a national contest, Elite Look of the Year, in which she placed second. BÃ¼ndchen placed fourth in the Elite Model Look world contest in Ibiza, Spain. At 14, BÃ¼ndchen moved to SÃ£o Paulo to launch her modeling career. In 1996, BÃ¼ndchen had her first New York City break at Fashion Week.</p><span>1997</span><p>BÃ¼ndchen travelled to London in 1997, where she auditioned for 42 shows. She got her big break when chosen for her ability to walk in towering heels on a slippery runway for <a href=#>Alexander McQueen</a>'s spring 1998 "rain" ready-to-wear show. Echoing similar accolades for Elle Macpherson a decade earlier, McQueen dubbed BÃ¼ndchen "the Body", immediately boosting her bookings. In 1998, she posed for Missoni, ChloÃ©, Dolce & Gabbana, Valentino, Gianfranco FerrÃ©, Ralph Lauren, and Versace campaigns. She made the cover of the <a href=#>French</a> edition of <i>Vogue</i>, and fashion magazine <i>i-D</i> featured her on its cover, profiling "A Girl Called Gisele." The <i>Vogue</i> online encyclopedia of <a href=#>Models</a> states, "As the year 2000 approached, Gisele BÃ¼ndchen was the world's hottest model, opening up a new category in the popular imagination: the <a href=#>Brazilian</a> bombshell."</p><span>1998</span><p>From 1998 to 1999, BÃ¼ndchen dated <a href=#>American</a> model Scott Barnhill. In 2000, she had a brief relationship with <a href=#>American</a> actor Josh Hartnett. From 2000 to 2005, BÃ¼ndchen was in a relationship with <a href=#>American</a> actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In 2004, BÃ¼ndchen and DiCaprio made <i>People</i><span class=nowrap style=padding-left:.1em>'</span>s annual Most Beautiful Couples List. BÃ¼ndchen dated <a href=#>Brazilian</a> businessman and polo player Rico Mansur for six months between 2002 and 2003, after BÃ¼ndchen and DiCaprio broke up for the first time. In 2006, she dated <a href=#>American</a> <a href=#>Surfer</a> Kelly Slater.</p><span>1999</span><p>She appeared on the cover of <i>Vogue</i> in July, November and December 1999. She won the VH1/<i>Vogue</i> Model of the Year for 1999, and a January 2000 cover gave her three consecutive <i>Vogue</i> covers. In 2000, she became the fourth model to appear on the cover of the music magazine <i>Rolling Stone</i> when she was named "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World". BÃ¼ndchen has appeared on the covers of many top fashion magazines, including <i>W</i>, <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, <i>Elle</i>, <i>Allure</i>, as well as style and lifestyle publications such as <i>The Face</i>, <i>Arena</i>, <i>Citizen K</i>, <i>Flair</i>, <i>GQ</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, and <i>Marie Claire,</i> and in the <i>Pirelli Calendar in 2001 and 2006.</i> She has also been seen in <i>TIME</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, and <i>Veja</i>. BÃ¼ndchen has appeared on more than 1,200 magazine covers throughout the world. She simultaneously featured on the covers of both the US and <a href=#>British</a> editions of <i>Vogue</i> in January 2000.</p><span>2000</span><p>In 2000, BÃ¼ndchen was dubbed the "Boobs from Brazil" for inspiring the 36,000 breast enhancement surgeries performed that year in <a href=#>Brazil</a>. In 2006, <i>Elle</i> surveyed the <a href=#>American</a> leading stylists and asked them to name the star whose hair was a favourite for their clients. More than 50 percent gave BÃ¼ndchen the title of best hair in Hollywood. In February 2008, a survey by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) asked the question, "What influences do celebrities have on the decisions patients make"? The survey was sent to more than 20,000 plastic <a href=#>Surgeons</a> in 84 countries. BÃ¼ndchen was among the most frequently mentioned celebrities. BÃ¼ndchen won the abdomen and hair categories and placed second in the breasts category. In 2008, a black-and-white photo of BÃ¼ndchen, shot by Irving Penn, auctioned for $193,000 (Â£96,000). BÃ¼ndchen's fetched by far the most on the night.</p><span>2002</span><p>In November 2002, BÃ¼ndchen was paid a reported Â£320,000 and given two black mink coats by <a href=#>American</a> fur company Blackglama to head its new advertising campaign. <a href=#>Activists</a> from PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), invaded the runway during the Victoria's Secret show in New York and brandished placards saying "Gisele: fur scum". The <a href=#>Brazilian</a> was one of the most prominent <a href=#>Models</a> to wear fur since it began to come back into acceptability in fashion circles. A PETA spokesperson said: "By getting into bed with the fur-pushers, Gisele has become PETA enemy number one. Every time that Gisele or anyone else wears furs they are sentencing countless animals to a violent and cruel death."</p><span>2004</span><p>Photographed by Steven Meisel, she was presented on the September 2004 cover of <a href=#>American</a> <i>Vogue</i> as one of the "Models of the Moment". In 2004, BÃ¼ndchen co-starred with Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon in the 2004 remake of <i>Taxi</i>. In 2005, she was chosen to wear the Victoria's Secret Fantasy Bra again, the Sexy Splendor Fantasy Bra. At the time, it was the second-most expensive bra ever made, valued at $12.5 million. In its December 2005 issue, <i>New York</i> magazine list Bundchen as No. 43 in its list of 123 reasons to love New York City.</p><span>2005</span><p>BÃ¼ndchen donated $150,000 to Brazil's Zero Hunger program. She designed a limited necklace edition for <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, crafted by jewelers Gumuchian Fils. These necklaces were sold to raise money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She contributed an autographed iPod loaded with a personal playlist to be auctioned off, with all proceeds benefiting Music Rising, a campaign founded in 2005 to replace lost or destroyed instruments of <a href=#>Musicians</a> in the Gulf Coast Region after hurricane disasters.</p><span>2006</span><p>In 2006, BÃ¼ndchen became the face of <a href=#>American</a> Express Red, part of the Product Red initiative. A portion of earnings from this credit card are donated to HIV/AIDS victims in <a href=#>Africa</a>. In 2009, she appeared on 30 covers of the international issues of <i>Elle</i> wearing Product Red clothing and posing with products from companies who support the same cause.</p><span>2007</span><p>In July 2007 <i>Forbes</i> named her the world's top-earning model. By 2008, she continued to dominate the <i>Forbes</i> list of the world's highest-earning <a href=#>Models</a>, and appeared on the magazine's list of the Top 20 <a href=#>richest</a> Women in Entertainment. During 2009â€“2010, she was the top earning supermodel.</p><span>2008</span><p>In 2008 BÃ¼ndchen and Brady dished out <a href=#>Turkey</a> and all the trimmings unannounced to over 400 job trainees in Roxbury <a href=#>Massachusetts</a> for Goodwill Industries International.</p><span>2009</span><p>BÃ¼ndchen began dating New <a href=#>England</a> Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in December 2006. In 2009, Brady revealed they had been set up on a blind date by a mutual friend. BÃ¼ndchen and Brady married on 26 February 2009 in a small Catholic ceremony at St. <a href=#>Monica</a> Catholic Church in Santa <a href=#>Monica</a>, <a href=#>California</a>. In April 2009, the couple held a second marriage ceremony, in Costa Rica. BÃ¼ndchen and Brady have two children, a son born in 2009 and a daughter born in 2012. She is also stepmother to Brady's first son from his previous relationship with <a href=#>Actress</a> Bridget Moynahan, whom Brady had split with in December 2006. In 2010, BÃ¼ndchen told <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> how important breastfeeding is for her. BÃ¼ndchen and her family eat primarily a plant-based diet.</p><span>2010</span><p>In 2010, she retained the top spot as Forbes's highest-earning model. In May 2011, <i>Forbes</i> ranked her as the world's top-earning model for the fifth consecutive time. Her earnings climbed over the previous year, thanks to an economic boom in <a href=#>Brazil</a>, coupled with a 10 per cent surge in the value of the <a href=#>Brazilian</a> real against the dollar. Also in 2013 she ranked No. 3 on the 16 most successful female entrepreneurs list by <i>Forbes</i>.</p><span>2011</span><p>In August 2011, BÃ¼ndchen ranked 60th on the <i>Forbes</i> list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women.

She ranked in the top 10 of the <i>Forbes</i> list of "Entertainment's Highest-Paid Women" in 2012, at No. 8.</p><span>2012</span><p>In January 2012, BÃ¼ndchen visited Kenya on a goodwill mission to improve <a href=#>Energy</a> poverty. She spent a day with a family in a village in Kisumu County and helped them with tasks such as carrying firewood to their hut&nbsp;â€“ while discussing the dangers of using firewood inside homes that do not have <a href=#>Energy</a>. She danced with the locals and visited various homes, as well as teaming up with UK NGO Practical Action during the course of her stay. In April 2012 she donated money for AIDS research. On the eve of World Environment Day 4 June 2012, BÃ¼ndchen, who is Goodwill Ambassador of the UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme), went to Rio de Janeiro to plant the first of a series of 50,000 trees in a degraded area.</p><span>2013</span><p>BÃ¼ndchen, however, disputes the number, telling <i>WSJ.</i> magazine in November 2013, "Who are they speaking to when they come up with these numbers? Not my accountant, that's for sure."</p><span>2014</span><p>In January 2014, BÃ¼ndchen joined the Rainforest Alliance board of <a href=#>Directors</a>.</p><span>2015</span><p>In May 2015, <a href=#>Brazilian</a> magazine Istoe Gente reported that BÃ¼ndchen's line of INtimates, Gisele Bundchen INtimates has been lucrative.
