Presently, her parents are unknown to us. However, since it’s a developing story, we are digging to find up-to-date information and will update this article accordingly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/12104954/Emily-Matson-Death-1.jpg><p>Emily Matson died at 42 on Monday, December 11, 2023. NBC affiliate WIPU’s parent company, Lilly Broadcasting confirmed her death on Monday but did not mention the cause making it unknown whether she battled any form of illness or died through an accident.</p><p>A statement released Monday on behalf of the Lilly Broadcasting family reads:</p><p>“It is with a very heavy heart that we have learned of the passing of our beloved Erie News Now news anchor Emily Matson”</p><p>“Emily was a shining light in our newsroom, delivering news with a passion and love she had for the Erie community and Northwest Pennsylvania”</p><p>“We loved Emily dearly and our hearts go out to the Matson family and her husband Ryan at this time”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/12104954/Emily-Matson-Death-1.jpg><p>Matson began her career as an intern at Erie’s WJET-TV in the early 2000s. She then moved to WICU where she first produced the station’s morning show for two years before landing a gig as an on-air reporter.</p><p>“I was sad to leave the morning crew, but excited when offered the reporter job I’d been striving for,” Matson wrote on her bio page.</p><p>“As a general assignment reporter, I focused on the crime beat since my first day on the job, and I love it! I feel I’m really making a difference in the Erie community, meeting new people, and telling the stories that affect everybody every day”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Matson</a> went on to co-anchor WICU’s nightly 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. and was a two-time winner of the Outstanding Spot News Award from the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters.</p><p>Following her demise, tributes have poured in. Her former colleague and Tennessee-based WVLT anchor Christyn Allen called Matson a hard worker, goofball, and “your biggest cheerleader” in a statement via Instagram</p><p>“I’ve been trying to come up with the words, but it could never be enough. This does not feel real. My coworker, turned friend, turned sister. From the moment I stepped into the Erie News Now newsroom, I knew me and this lady were going to be friends. But that’s just it. To know Emily Matson was to love her”</p><p>She was a voice of reason, the brightest light, an insanely hard worker, a goofball and your biggest cheerleader. She was a fiercely loyal friend, and if you were lucky enough to be one of her people, you’d hit the jackpot. She always made sure her people were taken care of. I’m so thankful our paths crossed, and we never lost touch. Your Tennessee Honey loves you forever, Em”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp6koqSpYrqiwNKopWaokaeyr8DSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
