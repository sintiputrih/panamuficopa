It’s not unusual for celebrities to have <a href=#>public social media accounts</a> for their fans — and private ones for their friends.</p><p>The Kardashian sisters are all super-active on Instagram, but according to <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>, there’s more going on behind the scenes that fans don’t get to see. During a June 2019 episode of <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>, the Poosh founder revealed that her younger sisters <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a> have finstas, or fake Instagrams.</p><p>Kourtney revealed the names of her sisters’ secret accounts on the show, but the intrepid editors at KUWTK censored them. While live-tweeting the episode, <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> noted that she also had an undercover account, but <a href=#>she couldn’t see the appeal</a>.</p><p>“Kourtney made me a Finsta when we were drunk and I’ve only used it once,” she wrote at the time. “To me, it’s pointless.”</p><p>While some celebrities use their secret social media accounts to share private photos with their inner circle, others give their alternative profiles a theme. In 2017, <a href=#><strong>Lorde</strong></a> was outed as the mastermind behind <a href=#>Onion Rings Worldwide</a>, an Instagram solely devoted to reviewing onion rings at restaurants around the globe.</p><p>During a June 2017 interview on <a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>, the “Solar Power” singer <a href=#>confirmed the she was the appetizer connoisseur</a> who made the page.</p><p>“I sort of naively didn’t realize it would be, like, a thing that I was going to different places and trying the onion rings at each of those places,” she explained. “I feel like it reads like the kind of thing that a pop star would do to, like, look relatable.”</p><p>The Grammy winner added that the account started as a “funny thing” she and her friends thought of while on tour. “I was like, ‘This is a good pastime,'” she joked before noting that she deleted it after just four posts. “I just felt like it was, like, ‘Now everyone knows about it,’ and … people are gonna be throwing onion rings at me on tour, and it’s gonna, like, turn into a whole thing. It was fun for, like, five seconds, but I’m still gonna keep eating onion rings.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Eventually, however, the pull of fried onions proved to be too strong, because Lorde reinstated Onion Rings Worldwide in December 2020. “Don’t call it a crumb back,” she wrote alongside a photo of two golden rings.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see more celebrities who’ve maintained secret social media accounts:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJuqZq%2BZqbVuv8ScqZ6sXai8pLXApWSmnZSerm6twpymrqakqHqsxcuinGailaO7pr6MpqarnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
