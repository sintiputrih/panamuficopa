He sets the tone and it's just a pleasure.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>3</td><td>They're [TV and film] very different. TV is obviously a lot quicker paced. I think film requires a lot more patience and concentration and each day you're keeping the entire picture in your head throughout a two to three month film shoot. Whereas TV, especially half hour, is like doing a play a week or live theater.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>4</td><td>Music is so much fun because each song is like a film in itself. You get to go from beginning to end and interact and exchange energy with a live audience.</td></tr><tr readability=6.8771929824561><td>5</td><td>[on <a href=#>John Candy</a>] I did get to know him a bit while we filmed <a href=#>Who's Harry Crumb?</a> (1989). If he could have been a fraction as kind, supportive, and giving to himself as he was to every single person around him then I think he'd still be with us today. That was the tragedy. I think [Candy's performance in] <a href=#>Planes, Trains & Automobiles</a> (1987) best defines who he was as a person. It breaks your heart.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>6</td><td>As a woman I'm very endeared to her [Amanda Young] and I'm hoping other women will be endeared to her. Hopefully we can all learn something or be inspired in some positive way.</td></tr><tr readability=6.9302325581395><td>7</td><td>(On the role of "Amanda" in <a href=#>Saw</a> (2004)) The great thing about Amanda is she gets to kick ass but she's also a woman of substance and depth and she's struggling. There is real drama. I see a lot of myself in her. The desire to build, the desire to serve something higher, and also the destructiveness.</td></tr><tr readability=3.9489361702128><td>8</td><td>I remember being at the first screening [of <a href=#>Saw</a> (2004)] at Sundance and you could feel the energy in the theater. It was incredible. You knew right there that this thing was going to be a hit. The first one was a really creative idea.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>9</td><td>(Comparing songwriting to acting) When you write a song you're writing it from your gut, so it's easier to connect with that than someone else's part that you're acting.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>10</td><td>(On the Smith and Pyle fanbase) I think the horror fans are surprised when they listen to the record and they actually like it. I mean it's country music, kind of, but it's produced by Chris Goss of Masters of Reality. It crosses a lot of boundaries.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>11</td><td>(in reference to horror films) I don't like to see a scary image because it sticks in my mind. Which is maybe why I get hired to do the scary movies because I'm truly scared and upset.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>12</td><td>(after winning a 2007 Eyegore award) This scares me [referring to the award statue], I can't bring it home because of my children, I can't watch my own clip, the ghouls at the entrance of tonight upset me, but I do want to say thank you to everyone.</td></tr><tr readability=7.8186397984887><td>13</td><td>(On the role of "Amanda" in <a href=#>Saw</a> (2004)) Amanda's been a great part to play over the years. She's my lucky strike. I take the scream queen title as an honor. I went from <a href=#>Becker</a> (1998) to this character and they were so vastly different. Amanda's really changed, too. She gives a few, but she gets you. With any character I play, I gravitate to the juxtaposition and humor. It has been a fun ride.</td></tr><tr readability=4.9438202247191><td>14</td><td>(On the jaw trap in <a href=#>Saw</a> (2004)) It was heavy. I had this mouth piece I had to clamp down and they padded it up to try and get it as tight to my head as possible because I really had to fling myself around. If I do something like that, I just go all the way with it.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>15</td><td>Acting is like a game of tennis. The better your opponent, the better you're going to play. I've had some of my best tennis matches with Tobin [Bell] because he's relentless about truth and has an incredible work ethic.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=37.469911213417><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>She is of English, German, Swiss-German, and Scots-Irish (Northern Irish) ancestry.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>Her conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy in 2012 was the inspiration behind her directorial debut documentary 'Orthodox: A Love Story'.</td></tr><tr readability=3.2533333333333><td>3</td><td>Attended the Texas Frightmare Weekend convention in Dallas, TX as part of the <a href=#>Saw</a> (2004) panel alongside <a href=#>Cary Elwes</a> and <a href=#>Costas Mandylor</a>.
