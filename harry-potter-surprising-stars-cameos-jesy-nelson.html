albeit briefly.</p><p>Dancing With the Stars stunner Julianne appeared as an unnamed Gryffindor in the first film, while her brother played a Ravenclaw student holding an owl in the same film, as students headed home for Christmas.</p><p>The pair landed the roles alongside other students while at a performing arts music school.</p><h3>Michelle Fairley</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/0f7bac57-d9b2-42b7-b377-04e7cc98fed9.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000635842640.jpg><p>Most fans will know actress Michelle Fairley as Catelyn Stark in Game Of Thrones.</p><p>But before then she had a brief spot in the second-to-last Harry Potter film.</p><p>She plays Hermione's mum in a particularly eerie scene at the start, as the young wizard is forced to wipe both her parents' memories of her.</p><h3>Jonny Greenwood and&nbsp;Phil Selway</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000635871629.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000635871052.jpg><p>Producers also ensured they had the best of the best in the fourth film when it came to a live band at the Yule Ball.</p><p>The Weird Sisters are seen performing on stage as the young wizards dance in front of them, and many Radiohead fans may have been doing double takes.</p><p>The band members are actually made up of real life musicians Jonny Greenwood and Phil Selway from the popular group - and they're even joined by Pulp's Jarvis Cocker, alongside more famous stars.</p><h3>Julie Christie</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000635846120.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000635845244.jpg><p>Julie Christie is an icon of the 'Swinging Sixties', appearing in everything from Doctor Zhivago to Darling.</p><p>She has won top awards including an Oscar, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA.</p><p>So Harry Potter producers were no doubt over the moon when she agreed to play a small part in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - as Madam Rosmerta.</p><h3>Ian Brown</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000635847026.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000635846819.jpg><p>Another star to swap music for acting was lead singer of The Stone Roses, Ian Brown.</p><p>The Britpop star appeared briefly in the third film too.</p><p>Shortly after Harry arrives at the Leaky Cauldron, Ian plays an unnamed wizard who is seen reading A Brief History Of Time and absent-mindedly stirring a drink.</p><h3>Alfred Enoch</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000263689953.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5d9c9dd9-5645-467b-b6f7-d1858c952e4b.jpg><p>Another recognisable face to many will be Dean in the films, who's played by Alfred Enoch.</p><p>Alfred is now well known by many for his role in How to Get Away with Murder, playing Wes Gibbins.</p><h3>Verne Troyer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8f30ef21-15bf-4602-8579-f5182a814e98.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000400728235.jpg><p>Acting legend Verne Troyer was an early addition to the Harry Potter line-up, as he made an appearance in the first film.</p><p>The late star played Griphook in the first instalment -
