Wade, and women’s rights have caused a rift between Jennifer Lawrence and her parents.</p><p>In a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>, in which she shared details about her new movie <a href=#>Causeway</a> and her 1-year-old son Cy, the conversation repeatedly drifted back to politics. Jennifer revealed that <a href=#>Donald Trump’</a>s election victory in 2016 was the launching point for familial discord.</p><p>Jennifer told the outlet that she’s spent the last five years trying to forgive her family and to understand their right-leaning stance on government policy. She admitted that she's tried to rationalize their views by saying, “It’s different. The information they are getting is different. Their life is different.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Vogue</a><p>Jennifer Lawrence on the cover of 'Vogue,' October 2022</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Tina Fey and '30 Rock' changed Jennifer Lawrence's political point of view.</h2><p>Growing up in Louisville, Kentucky with a staunchly Republican family, Jennifer went with the flow, but her views changed at the age of 16 after watching an episode of NBC's 30 Rock starring <a href=#>Tina Fey</a> as Liz Lemon.</p><p>While not completely in <a href=#>Hillary Clinton</a>’s camp, Jennifer admits the election broke her heart “because America had the choice between a woman and a dangerous, dangerous jar of mayonnaise. And they were like, well, we can’t have a woman. Let’s go with the jar of mayonnaise.”</p><p>In the interview, Jennifer also expressed her outrage about carbon emissions, gun laws, and male politicians grandstanding over their opinions on the female body.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Dia Dipasupil/FilmMagic</span><p>Jennifer Lawrence attends the world premiere of Netflix's "Don't Look Up"</p></figure><p>“It’s too personal to a female’s existence to watch white men debate over uteruses when they, from the bottom of their hearts, can’t find a clitoris,” she said.</p><p>But she's also disappointed in what she sees as a lackluster response from Democrats and feels the two-party system is a failure.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jennifer Lawrence can't get her parents' different politics opinions.</h2><p>Last year, following the birth of her son, Jennifer sought to build back a bridge with her family. But when the Supreme Court overturned <a href=#>Roe v.
