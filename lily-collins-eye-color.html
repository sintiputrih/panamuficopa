While many people are impressed with her performance in the show, they also have been praising the actress for her sensational beauty.</strong></p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Emily in Paris</a></strong>, a <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Netflix</a></strong> romantic series, follows Emily Cooper, a Chicago-based marketing executive who moves to Paris to be the American voice for her company Savoir. When Emily first arrives in Paris, she forms an admirable friendship with Camille, unaware that she is Gabriel's girlfriend, with whom Emily has been growing emotionally and physically close.</p><p>The third season of Netflix's romantic series begins with Emily and Alfie's conflicts as the former becomes engrossed in two jobs that keep her away from her boyfriend. When Emily fails to attend Alfie's farewell party, the latter finds it unacceptable and ceases communication with her. Emily eventually realizes that Alfie has not returned to London and is currently in Paris as the new CFO of <strong>Antoine Lamber</strong>t's perfume company Maison Lavaux.</p><p>As the show's third season hit the mainstream, many viewers have been fascinated by <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Lily Collins</strong></a>, who plays the character of Emily Cooper in the series, especially with her amazing eyes. Many fans have been in love with the actress' eyes color. However, people are confused about what color her eyes are. Let's find it out.</p><p>Previously, we touched on&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Mindy Chen</a> </strong>played by <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ashley Park</strong></a>.</p><h2>Lily Collins' Eye Color: The Emily in Paris Star Has Green/Hazel Colored Eyes!</h2><p><strong>Lily Jane Collins</strong> aka <strong>Lily Collins</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@lilyjcollins</a>) who plays Emily Cooper on Netflix's Emily in Paris was born in Guildford on March 18, 1989. In the series, her title character may be best known for her killer fashion sense, but the model and actress is a total beauty icon with her bold brows, green eyes/hazel color eyes, and flawless milky complexion which has been admired by many of her fans.</p><p>Hazel eyes are typically a mix of brown, green, and gold, though they can appear to be any of those colors from a distance. Hazel frequently refers to an individual's iris being a different color than the outer rim, giving their eyes a bright, vibrant, multicolored appearance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the British/American actress and model is the daughter of English musician <strong>Phil Collins</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@officialphilcollins</a>) and his second wife, <strong>Jill Tavelman</strong>, a former president of the Beverly Hills Women's Club. Likely, the actress also has two younger half-brothers from her father's third marriage, as well as half-sisters <strong>Simon Collins</strong> and <strong>Joely Collins</strong> from her father's first marriage.</p><p>Later, Collins moved to Los Angeles with her mother following her parents' divorce in 1996, when she was six years old. Then, she&nbsp;graduated from Harvard-Westlake School and went on to study broadcast journalism at the University of Southern California. In 2007, she was introduced as a debutante at the Bal des débutantes in Paris. Collins suffered from an eating disorder as a teenager, which she later revealed in her <a href=# rel=noopener>book</a>, Unfiltered: No Shame, No Regrets, Just Me.</p><p>Collins debuted on the BBC series Growing Pains at the age of two. Then Collins appeared in two episodes of the teen drama series 90210 in 2009, including the season premiere. Later that year, Collins made her breakthrough as Collins Tuohy, the daughter of <strong>Leigh Anne Tuohy</strong>, in the film The Blind Side. The film was a box-office success, grossing over <strong>$250 million</strong> and becoming the highest-grossing sports drama of all time.</p><p>Later, Collins was originally cast as the lead in the Evil Dead remake in 2013 but dropped out due to a scheduling conflict. In M83's music video Claudia Lewis, released in August 2013, she played the title role as an Earth-visiting alien. She then played Clary Fray in The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, a film adaptation of <strong>Cassandra Clare</strong>'s New York Times best-selling novel The Mortal Instruments novels for which she was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for her performance.</p><p>Likewise, Collins also wrote a column called NY Confidential&nbsp;for the British magazine Elle Girl when she was a teenager. She has also contributed to Seventeen Magazine, Teen Vogue, and the Los Angeles Times. Chanel chose her to wear one of their gowns to the 2007 Bal des débutantes at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris, which was featured on season three of the reality TV show The Hills. She was named International Model of the Year by Spain's Glamour magazine in 2008, and she appeared on the magazine's cover in August 2009.</p><p>Collins also hosted the Nickelodeon show Kids Pick the President during the 2008 US presidential election. She received a Young Hollywood Award in 2008 for Newest Red Carpet Correspondent. Collins was named one of the 20 Hottest Daughters of Rock Stars by Maxim magazine in 2009.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>Presently, Collins is a vocal anti-bullying advocate and a Celebrity Ambassador for the anti-bullying organization Bystander Revolution.
