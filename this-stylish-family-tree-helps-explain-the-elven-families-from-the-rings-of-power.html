Harder still is keeping track of who is related to who, especially in the case of the long-living elves who seem to have a proclivity for dating relatives, even if they are somewhat distant. One fan artist created a beautiful and helpful family tree to aid those who may be struggling to keep everything in order.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=546 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>The race of elves is vast, but when it comes to nobility, though still confusing, it starts to become a little more compact. The artist <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@Cy-lindric</a>, who posted the image to Twitter, chose to focus on the descendants of the High King of the √ëoldor, Finw√´, which encompasses many of the main characters we have come to know through the movies and now in The Rings of Power series. The family tree of Finw√´ shows the marriages and children of the Finw√´ line, with beautiful illustrations of the artist‚Äôs interpretation for each character.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>There it is !

Each portrait shows a little personality for each character making the overall image highly interesting and engaging.</p><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>From the line of Finw√´ came some of the most powerful elves in Middle-earth and also amongst them were many half-elves, who were born from a human parent and an elf parent. This is the case for Elrond and his brother Elros who were born to parents who were also half elf, half human. An elf can choose immortality or not, and where Elrond decided to remain an immortal elf his brother Elros chose differently and went on to become the first King of N√∫menor, the race of long-lived humans we have now met in the third episode of The Rings of Power.</p><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>Galadriel is also a part of this family, granddaughter to Finw√´ and daughter to Finarfin and E√§rwen. This makes her Elrond‚Äôs great, great aunt. However, that didn‚Äôt stop Elrond from marrying her daughter, Celerbr√≠an, making Galadriel his mother-in-law and his daughter Arwen‚Äôs grandmother. See, it is very confusing. Not to mention that Aragorn is a descendant of the kings of N√∫menor and therefore very very distantly related to Elrond as well, making Arwen, his wife, also his distant cousin with roughly 80 generations separating the two.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>As well as the characters that are more prominent in the books there are plenty of other notable mentions within the family tree. The house of Finw√´ has seen its fair share of strife and tragedy, with figures enacting great deeds but also being misguided by the evil whisperings of the evil Melkor/Morgoth.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>Even with this handy family tree, it can still be exceptionally confusing and if you wish to find out more about the characters and gain some clarity, reading The Simarillion may help.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMisZKysqaG2tLSMn5imoZyuerW%2BxJ5koZ2cpcBusdepo5qhnmLBqbGMnqOvnZ5is6K5yKWgnqtdm7%2BwuYytn55lop67qL%2BMqJ1mqJ%2BssrN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
