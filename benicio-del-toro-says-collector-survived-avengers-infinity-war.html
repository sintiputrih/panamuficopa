Given the state of his lair and the character’s absence from the scene, many fans have all but assumed that he didn’t survive his encounter with the Mad Titan. Actor Benicio del Toro, however, seems optimistic about The Collector’s fate, hinting during his appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that Taneleer Tivan may still have a future in the MCU yet.</p><p>“I think he’s alive, yeah, I think that you know, I think he’s alive.”</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Of course, even if we had seen The Collector die on camera, we couldn’t be sure that he was out of the franchise for good, seeing how there’s hardly a death in this film that fans haven’t suspected might soon be reversed.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>In particular, the mass dusting that ended the movie is almost inevitably going to be undone, with several of the perished characters already having sequels lined up. Meanwhile, Loki’s supposed demise has been the subject of <a href=# rel=noopener>many a theory</a> and statements <a href=# rel=noopener>earlier this</a> year from Paul Bettany even hinted that Vision might still have more outings to come.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>As for The Collector, assuming he survived the events of <strong>Avengers: Infinity War</strong>, it remains to be seen whether Marvel Studios has any further projects lined up for the character, but with <a href=# rel=noopener>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</a> expected to arrive at some point <a href=# rel=noopener>in the distant future</a>, we wouldn’t rule out seeing more of del Toro in the MCU’s next phase.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomZ6mmZi2sHnDnqNmrJ%2BnvG6%2FwLKqZpufobmmr9OoqWarpafDqsLEnWSarpWjtKa%2B0magp56Zo7a1xYywmKtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
