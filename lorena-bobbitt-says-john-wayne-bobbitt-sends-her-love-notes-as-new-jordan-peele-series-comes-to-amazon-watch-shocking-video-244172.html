Soon, Amazon will debut their latest true crime series by Jordan Peele Lorena. The four-episode series premieres on Feb. 15, 2019, and recounts the harrowing tale of abuse that Lorena Bobbitt said led to her severing her then husband’s appendage while he was sleeping. In 1993, the story of Lorena and John Bobbitt dominated headlines as John’s member was ultimately reattached and Lorena Bobbitt went on trial.</p><p>Lorena Bobbitt was ultimately acquitted of all charges due to the physical and mental abuse she endured. Because the jury found Lorena Bobbitt to have committed the crime due to temporary insanity, she did spend 45 days in a psychiatric hospital for evaluation.</p><p>The couple has since divorced and Lorena now goes by the name Lorena Galo.</p><p>Before Lorena Bobbitt was on trial, John Wayne Bobbitt was on trial for rape. He too was acquitted.</p><p>Lorena granted an interview with Today&nbsp;prior to the premiere of the series and shocked the public when she stated that John Wayne Bobbitt tries to stay in touch with her and even sends her love notes.</p><p>John Wayne Bobbitt hasn’t spoken out about the claims.</p><p>You may watch Lorena Bobbitt (Galo’s) interview with Today in the video player below.</p><p></p><p>In the interview, Lorena stated that she doesn’t remember what happened during the attack, nor does she want to. She indicated that the abuse was so painful to her that it would be traumatizing to remember the events.</p><p>She also said that she is the mother of a 13-year-old daughter and has left the past behind her. Lorena also said that her daughter saw the documentary with her at Sundance and remarked to her mother that she had no idea how strong she truly was.</p><p>Lorena was also asked if she regrets the actions that occurred on June 23, 1993. Lorena replied with the following.</p><p>“Oh, my god, how could you regret something that was not planned. I mean, how could you-you have to understand. I wasn’t in my right mindset!”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The Amazon Prime series will feature Lorena Bobbitt, John Bobbitt, and Whoopi Goldberg.
