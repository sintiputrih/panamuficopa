Robert Vogelsang and Shirley (Kipp) Vogelsang were the ones that brought up Brian Vogelsang. His birthday is November 7th, 1963, and he was born in Wells, Minnesota. During the year 1982, he completed his high school education at Waldorf-Pemberton and was awarded his diploma. Because he wanted to further his education, he spent a brief period of time studying at the University of Minnesota in Waseca.</p><p>It was during his childhood that he spent a major deal of his time working alongside his parents. During the years that preceded his relocation to Minneapolis-St. Paul, where he currently resides and works, he joined his family on their dairy farm and supported them in their operations. In addition to watching the Minnesota Vikings, Brian enjoyed participating in sports. As much as he adored pheasant shooting, he also enjoyed farming. Bowling, playing cards, and other pastimes were some of his favourite things to do in his leisure time.</p><p>His parents, Robert and Shirley Vogelsang; his siblings, Mark Vogelsang and Sue of Fairmont, Jeff Vogelsang and Tricia of Bloomington, and Lynette Vogelsang of Wells; and a large number of his siblings; Brant Vogelsang and Tiffany Vogelsang of Battleground, Washington; Jordan Vogelsang and Samantha Vogelsang of Mankato; Jenna Vogelsang and her husband Jared of Ridgefield, Washington; Wayde and Logan Vogelsang, his grandchildren; and another large number of his siblings.</p><p>He was preceded in death by a number of aunts and uncles, including Melvin and Bertha Vogelsang, Gerald and Ethel Kipp, and another assortment of relatives. There will be a memorial service held in the Waldorf Community Centre on the 12th of December, 2023, at eleven o’clock when the clock strikes eleven. There will be a visitation in the Community Centre beginning one hour before the service is scheduled to begin. A flower delivery to the Waldorf Community Centre would be greatly appreciated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwrtGimKdlpqS0prjSmqWgZZ%2BXtrXBwKuwZqWRo7iiwM5mpKdlnJqus7qMpqarnV2Wr7DB02aZq6GRo3q3u8aeo6yZnpx6pbHArZ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
