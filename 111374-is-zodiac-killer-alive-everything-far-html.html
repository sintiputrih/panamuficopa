He is linked to at least five murders, but in his final cryptic letter in 1974, he claimed to have killed 37 people. His identity has never been cracked by the FBI, but a team of private investigators recently claimed to have finally nailed the puzzle five decades later. So is the Zodiac killer alive?

However, in October 2021, a cold-case task force called the Case Breakers claimed that they had finally <a href=# title="Zodiac killer" rel="nofollow noopener">decoded the identity</a> of the infamous <a href=#>serial murderer</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The team of about 40 investigators, made up of retired detectives, military intelligence officers and journalists, identified Gary Francis Poste as the real <a href=#>notorious murderer</a> of the late 1960s. Poste’s facial features match the Zodiac’s sketches, and they have the same shoe size. After decoding his cryptic notes, they discovered his full name. Unfortunately, the new Zodiac suspect passed away in 2018.</p><p class=align-left>The FBI is yet to release an official report but said they would look into the private investigators’ claims. Gary’s <a href=# title="Zodiac killer" rel="nofollow noopener">family has not commented</a> on the matter.
