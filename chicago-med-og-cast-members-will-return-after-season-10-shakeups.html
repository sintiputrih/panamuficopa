The most recent was <strong>Dominic Rains</strong>, <a href=#>who will not be returning for season 10</a> of Chicago Med after playing Dr. Crockett Marcel for the past five seasons.</p><p>Chicago Med faced another shakeup when showrunners <strong>Diane Frolov </strong>and<strong> Andy Schneider</strong> <a href=#>announced their departures after being with the show</a> since its debut. <strong>Allen MacDonald</strong> is now the showrunner starting with season 10.</p><p>“We were honored to be chosen by Dick Wolf to run Chicago Med and have tremendously enjoyed our association with Wolf Entertainment and Universal Television. We love Chicago Med and have devoted all our creative energies to it, but after nine seasons we feel it’s time for us to move on and explore other possibilities,” Frolov and Schneider said in a join statement in April. “We’ve been privileged to work with a great writing staff, production team and a brilliant cast of actors. We will miss them all.”</p><p>Wolf, 77, issued a response as well after news broke, saying, “We’re grateful to Diane and Andy for nine fabulous seasons of ‘Chicago Med.’ They helped us give NBC a No. 1 bonafide hit for almost a decade.”</p><p>Despite the large amount of cast changes, NBC’s president of program planning<strong> Jeff Bader</strong> <a href=#>isn’t concerned about the future of the franchise.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Chicago-Med-Original-Cast-Members-Close-New-Deals-to-Return-for-Season-10-After-Shocking-Shakeups-188.jpg><p>“Cast comes in, cast goes out,” Bader told TVLine in an interview published on Monday, July 1. “It’s interesting. Because every year there are cast changes, and every year someone asks the same question” about what’s going on within the One Chicago universe. “But [those shows] just keep going on.”</p><p>Bader noted that <a href=#>each of the Chicago shows has continued to find success</a>, adding, “We’re thrilled with how the Chicagos do on Wednesday. We have no plans on changing anything on that night.”</p><p>Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D. and Chicago Med are set to return on NBC with new seasons this fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhoZOWtLB5zJ6bZqeXYrCiv9NmpJ6lkpq%2FtHnWoqOlZaKawba%2BzWaYn6yVp3q0scCspqdlYWV6tLTApJyuqKNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
